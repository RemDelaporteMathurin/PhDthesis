	abstract = {Employing a thermodynamic model with previously calculated first-principle energetics as inputs, we determined the hydrogen (H) concentration at the interstitial and monovacancy as well as its dependence on temperature and pressure in tungsten and molybdenum. Based on this, we predicted the critical H concentration for H bubble formation at different temperatures. The critical concentration, defined as the value when the concentration of H at a certain mH-vacancy complex first became equal to that of H at the interstitial, was 24 ppm/7.3 GPa and 410 ppm/4.7 GPa at 600 K in tungsten and molybdenum in the case of a monovacancy. Beyond the critical H concentration, numerous H atoms accumulated in the monovacancy, leading to the formation and rapid growth of H-vacancy complexes, which was considered the preliminary stage of H bubble formation. We expect that the proposed approach will be generally used to determine the critical H concentration for H bubble formation in metals.},

	abstract = {The extreme brittleness of tungsten (W) is one of the challenges of using W as first wall material. One attempt to alleviate this problem is to use W alloys with better mechanical properties. However these alloying elements must not degrade the favorable properties of W with respect to its application at the first wall of fusion devices: low sputter yield and hydrogen inventory. In this work we investigate the hydrogen retention in the recently proposed W/Ta alloys under deuterium ion bombardment. By directly comparing pure W and W/Ta alloys with 1\% and 5\% Ta content we found that the W/Ta alloys retain significantly more hydrogen than pure W under identical implantation conditions. Our finding of increased hydrogen retention together with the fact that the Ta alloying did not improve the brittleness makes W/Ta alloys an unacceptable choice for the first wall of fusion devices.},

	abstract = {In future fusion devices, the incident hydrogen plasma with high mobility can diffuse deep into tungsten bulk, which is directly relevant with hydrogen isotopes permeation and retention in tungsten. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) and object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) simulations are adopted to investigate the hydrogen diffusion behavior in tungsten under anisotropic uniaxial strain from −2.5\% to 2.5\%. As presented by our DFT calculations, there are two types of hydrogen diffusion paths when applying strain, including one path perpendicular to the strain direction and another path largely along the strain direction. The migration energy barriers of these two paths have opposite variation tendencies in tensile or compressive condition. Our OKMC calculations based on DFT input show that, in tensile condition, the hydrogen diffusion is restrained despite the lower energy barrier of the corresponding diffusion path. In compressive condition, the hydrogen diffusion along the strain direction is enhanced, while that perpendicular to the strain direction is suppressed. The hydrogen diffusivity under anisotropic strain at the temperature range from 400 K to 1800 K is determined. It is demonstrated that tensile strain can suppress the diffusivity, while compressive strain can either suppress or facilitate the diffusivity depending on the temperature and the strain value. The anisotropic strain exhibits distinct effect on hydrogen diffusivity at lower temperature but its effect is minimal as the temperature increases.},

	abstract = {In fusion reactors, plasma facing components (PFC) and in particular the divertor will be irradiated with high fluxes of low energy (∼100 eV) helium and hydrogen ions. Tungsten is one of the leading candidate divertor materials for ITER and DEMO fusion reactors. However, the behavior of tungsten under high dose, coupled helium/hydrogen exposure remains to be fully understood. The PFC response and performance changes are intimately related to microstructural changes, such as the formation of point defect clusters, helium and hydrogen bubbles or dislocation loops. Computational materials modeling has been used to investigate the mechanisms controlling microstructural evolution in tungsten following high dose, high temperature helium exposure. The aim of this study is to understand and predict helium implantation, primary defect production and defect diffusion, helium-defect clustering and interactions below a tungsten surface exposed to low energy helium irradiation. The important defects include interstitial clusters, vacancy clusters, helium interstitials and helium-vacancy clusters. We report results from a one-dimensional, spatially dependent cluster dynamics model based on the continuum reaction–diffusion rate theory to describe the evolution in space and time of all these defects. The key parameter inputs to the model (diffusion coefficients, migration and binding energies, initial defect production) are determined from a combination of atomistic materials modeling and available experimental data.},

Small helium bubbles in nickel were observed to migrate in a random-walk style at temperatures higher than 0.7 Tm (melting point).

The motion of the helium bubbles in nickel proceeds by displacement of nickel atoms on the surface, which causes the rearrangement of other nickel atoms, resulting surface diffusion. These findings indicate that migration and coalescence may be the possible growth mechanism for small helium bubbles in nickel at high temperature.},

The same exposures were repeated in hydrogen (H) to allow a direct comparison of the role of the ion species on the thermal shock resistance. Exposure to He plasma pulses caused the formation of fine cracking network on W samples which occurred at a higher density and smaller depths compared to H pulsed plasma irradiation. The peak temperature reached during an ELM-like plasma pulse increased by a factor 1.45 over the 100 s of He plasma exposure, indicating a deterioration of the thermal properties. Transient loading experiments were also performed using a high power pulsed laser during He plasma exposure, showing a significant modification of the target thermal response caused by the surface damage. The effect of He-induced morphology changes on the thermal response modification was found to be very small compared to that of transient-induced damage.},

Molecular-statics (MS) simulations based on reliable many-body interatomic potentials are carried out for Hen (1 ≤ n ≤ 7) clusters near sinks to obtain the potential energy profiles of the Hen clusters as a function of the clusters' center-of-mass distance from a sink. Sinks investigated include surfaces, GBs, and regions in the vicinity of junctions where GBs intersect free surfaces. Elastic interaction potentials based on elastic inclusion theory provide an excellent description of the MS results for the cluster-sink interactions. The key parameter in the elastic models is the sink segregation strength, which is found to increase with increasing cluster size. Such cluster-sink interactions are responsible for the migration of small helium clusters by drift and for helium segregation on surfaces and grain boundaries in tungsten. Such helium segregation on sinks is observed in large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of helium aggregation in model polycrystalline tungsten at 933 K upon helium implantation.},

ERD was performed on samples with surface temperatures from Ts=530–1100K and irradiated by He flux densities of ΓHe∼1020–1022 m−2s−1. He concentration profiles in samples that developed either non-fuzzy or fuzzy surfaces are uniformly shaped with concentrations of 1.5–7at.\%, which is presumed to be too low for pressure driven growth models. Therefore, surface morphology changes are not perpetuated by continuous bubble bursting deformation. Also, a threshold in He flux density above 1020m−2s−1 is suggested by using in situ ERD to monitor the depth profile evolution of the He-rich layer while changing the flux during exposure.},

W was damaged by 20 MeV W ion bombardment and defects were populated by low-temperature D plasma at room temperature before He implantation. Deuterium depth profiling was performed in situ during isochronal annealing in the temperature range from 300 K to 800 K. It is shown for the first time unambiguously that He attracts D and locally increases D trapping. Deuterium retention increased by a factor of two as compared to a non-He implanted W reference after sample annealing at 450 K. Rate equation modelling can explain the measured D depth profiles quantitatively when keeping the de-trapping parameters unchanged but only increasing the number of traps in the He zone.

TEM observations after thinning exposed W samples with FIB revealed that the layer thickness ({\textgreater}30nm) of He bubbles largely exceeds the ion implantation range of a few nm. The size of He bubbles was found to increase with an increase in the sample temperature: it was around 10nm at 973K, while only small He bubbles of 1–2nm were observed at {\textless}773K. In addition, to obtain information on the initial formation behavior, in-situ TEM observations during He ion irradiation were also performed.},

	abstract = {Sputtering yields of He-induced W ‘fuzzy’ surfaces bombarded by Ar have been measured in the linear divertor plasma simulator PISCES-B. It is found that the sputtering yield of a fuzzy surface, Yfuzzy, decreases with increasing fuzzy layer thickness, L, and saturates at ∼10\% of that of a smooth surface, Ysmooth, at L{\textgreater}1μm. The reduction in the sputtering yield is suspected to be due mainly to the porous structure of fuzz, since the ratio, Yfuzzy/Ysmooth follows (1−pfuzz), where pfuzz is the fuzz porosity. Further, Yfuzzy/Ysmooth is observed to increase with incident ion energy, Ei. This may be explained by an energy dependent change in the angular distribution of sputtered W atoms, since at lower Ei, the angular distribution is observed to become more butterfly-shaped. That is, a larger fraction of sputtered W atoms can line-of-sight deposit/stick onto neighboring fuzz nanostructures for lower Ei butterfly distributions, resulting in lower ratio of Yfuzzy/Ysmooth.},

A nanostructured layer in excess of 5 µm thick is observed for the longest exposure time explored. The kinetics of the layer growth are found to follow Fick's law, characterized by an effective diffusive mechanism with coefficients of diffusion: D1120 K = 6.6 ± 0.4 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 and D1320 K = 2.0± 0.5 × 10−11 cm2 s−1. The diffusion of He atoms in W is considered too rapid to explain the observed growth of surface modification and points to the interplay of other mechanisms, such as the availability of thermal vacancies and/or the slower diffusion of He through the forming nanostructured layer.},

	abstract = {The near-surface region of plasma facing material (PFM) plays an important role in thermal management of fusion reactors. In this work, we measured thermal conductivity of tungsten (W) surface layers damaged by He plasma in PISCES at UCSD. We studied the damage effect on both bulk, and thin film, W. We observed that the surface morphology of both bulk and thin film was altered after exposure to He plasma with the fluence of 1 × 1026 m−2 (bulk) and 2 × 1024 m−2 (thin film). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that the depth of the irradiation damaged layer was approximately 20 nm on the bulk W exposed to He plasma at 773 K for 2000 s. In order to measure the thermal conductivity of this exceedingly thin damaged layer in the bulk W, we adopted the well-established ‘3-omega’ method and employed novel nanofabrication techniques to improve the measurement sensitivity. For the damaged W thin film sample, we measured the reduction in electrical conductivity and used the Wiedemann-Franz (W-F) law to extract the thermal conductivity. Results from both measurements show that thermal conductivity in the damaged layers was reduced by at least ∼80\% compared to that of undamaged W. This large reduction in thermal conductivity can be attributed to the scattering of electrons, the dominant heat carriers in W, caused by defects introduced by He plasma irradiation.},

	abstract = {High-purity aluminium (99.9999\%) was irradiated with 600 MeV protons with a damage rate of 3.5 × 10−6dpa/s. Irradiation with 600 MeV protons produces helium and hydrogen at the rate of 140 and 615 appm per dpa, respectively. Specimens irradiated at temperatures in the range 116 to 318 °C to doses in the range 0.04 to 5 dpa were examined in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM investigation has shown that helium bubbles are formed on dislocations in the grains as well as dislocations in the grain boundaries. Dislocation nodal points whether present in dislocation walls or in grain boundaries are found to be the most favourable sites for bubble nucleation. The mean diameter of the bubbles on individual dislocation lines are found to be larger than those for the bubbles in the matrix. The bubble size and density on grain boundaries vary from boundary to boundary. The size of these bubbles on the boundaries is larger than or equal to the size of those in the matrix. It is suggested that helium atoms once arrived at a dislocation remain bound to the dislocation line but at the same time remain mobile within the dislocation core; the bubble nucleation behaviour in the core would thus be affected by the core structure of the different dislocations. An estimate of the effective helium diffusion in the dislocations relative to that in the lattice has been made on the basis of the measured bubble parameters and the width of the bubble-denuded zone along dislocation lines; the diffusion coefficient of helium in the dislocations is found to be about the same as that in the lattice.},

	abstract = {An in-depth understanding of the formation of intergranular helium bubbles and its relation to embrittlement is an important issue in the nuclear industry. In this paper, a thermodynamic model is developed to analyze the nucleation of intergranular helium bubbles. Microstructural observation using scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction gives a detailed description for the relation between the bubble formation and the grain-boundary (GB) misorientation in helium-implanted nickel and Inconel X750. The theoretical and the experimental results confirm that the nucleation of intergranular helium bubbles is GB structure-dependent, the helium-to-vacancy ratio plays an important role in the bubble precipitation, and the interfacial tension of bubbles cannot be approximated to be the interfacial energy. The bubble-induced intergranular embrittlement in a polycrystal is modelled. The GB misorientation distribution, the intergranular bubble nucleation and growth and the GB connectivity are the key factors affecting the GB fracture toughness. The hoop ductility of the cladding tubes containing helium is analyzed. The hoop stress-induced increase in the GB energy promotes the precipitation of bubbles at the radial GBs and lead to the loss of tube ductility. Based on this work, the complicated correlation among the intergranular helium bubbles, the GB structure, the helium concentration, the applied stress and the helium embrittlement is clarified.},

	abstract = {Palladium can readily dissociate molecular hydrogen at its surface, and rapidly accept it onto the octahedral sites of its face-centered cubic crystal structure. This can include radioactive tritium. As tritium β-decays with a half-life of 12.3 years, He-3 is generated in the metal lattice, causing significant degradation of the material. Helium bubble evolution at high concentrations can result in blister formation or exfoliation and must therefore be well understood to predict the longevity of materials that absorb tritium. A hydrogen over-pressure must be applied to palladium hydride to prevent hydrogen from desorbing from the metal, making it difficult to study tritium in palladium by methods that involve vacuum, such as electron microscopy. Recent improvements in in-situ ion implantation Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) allow for the direct observation of He bubble nucleation and growth in materials. In this work, we present results from preliminary experiments using the new ion implantation Environmental TEM (ETEM) at the University of Huddersfield to observe He bubble nucleation and growth, in-situ, in palladium at cryogenic temperatures in a hydrogen environment. After the initial nucleation phase, bubble diameter remained constant throughout the implantation, but bubble density increased with implantation time. β-phase palladium hydride was not observed to form during the experiments, likely indicating that the cryogenic implantation temperature played a dominating role in the bubble nucleation and growth behavior.},

	abstract = {Helium injected into tungsten has been found to undergo rapid interstitial diffusion at room temperature unless it encounters lattice defects. This effect has been used in a study of the lattice damage produced near a (100) tungsten surface by the impact of small numbers of 5 keV heavy ions. The helium, injected as 250eV ions, does not itself produce any observable damage, but is trapped in that created by the prior heavy ion bombardment. Thermal desorption spectra obtained by raising the crystal temperature at 40°K/sec show that the helium is bound with several discrete energies. Attempts to correlate the binding states with particular lattice defects have been made by varying the damage anneal temperature, the helium dose, the helium injection temperature and the mass of the damaging ion. The results suggest that all of the entrapment occurs at defects of the vacancy type, and that the binding energy is modified by parameters that change the available vacancy volume. In particular there is evidence that at least two and possibly three helium atoms can be trapped in a single vacancy, that two types of divacancies exist, and that vacancies become trapped in the strain field of large impurity atoms. It also appears that at sufficiently high helium doses ({\textgreater} 1014 ions/ cm2), any of the trapping sites can act as nuclei for the formation of helium bubbles.},

A damaged layer of 10 nm thickness was formed on the sample surface with a destroyed crystalline structure. Helium-bubbles and surface modification in nanoscale were observed. Thermal conductivities of the ultra-thin damaged layers were measured by the transient thermoreflectance technique. Result shows that the thermal conductivity reduced two orders of magnitude compared to the bulk value and decreased with increasing irradiation temperature and fluence. Moreover, the helium-irradiated samples were exposed to ELM-like heat load produced by electron beam on EMS-60. The pulse length was 1 ms and each sample was exposed to 5 pulses. Melting occurred under power density of 1.7 GW m−2. As the thermal conductivity of the damaged layer decreased, the molten bath of the irradiated sample deepened. The degraded thermal conductivity led to a lower melting threshold. The characterization of the thermal conductivity of the damaged layer induced by the plasma irradiation is a promising way to estimate the damage level, as well as the failure threshold, of the plasma facing components.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is a leading candidate material for the diverter in future nuclear fusion reactors. Previous experiments have demonstrated that surface defects and bubbles form in tungsten when ex- posed to helium and hydrogen plasmas, even at modest ion energies. In some regimes, between 1000K and 2000K, and for He energies below 100eV, "fuzz" like features form. The mechanisms leading to these surfaces comprised of nanometer sized tungsten tendrils which include visible helium bubbles are not currently known. The role of helium bubble formation in tendril morphology could very likely be the starting point of these mechanisms. Using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of helium and hydrogen exposure in the initial formation mechanisms of tungsten "fuzz" are investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations are well suited to describe the time and length scales associated with initial formation of helium clusters that eventually grow to nano-meter sized helium bubbles. MD simulations also easily enable the modeling of a variety of surfaces such as single crystals, grain boundaries or "tendrils".While the sputtering yield of tungsten is generally low, previous observations of surface modification due to plasma exposure raise questions about the effects of surface morphology and sub-surface helium bubble populations on the sputtering behavior. Results of computational molecular dynamics are reported that investigate the influence of sub-surface helium bubble distributions on the sputtering yield of tungsten (100) and (110) surfaces induced by helium ion exposure in the range of 300 eV to 1 keV. The calculated sputtering yields are in reasonable agreement with a wide range of experimental data; but do not show any significant variation as a result of the pre-existing helium bubbles.Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a number of sub-surface mechanisms leading to nanometer- sized "fuzz" in tungsten exposed to low-energy helium plasmas. We find that during the bubble formation process, helium clusters create self-interstitial defect clusters in tungsten by a trap mutation process, followed by the migration of these defects to the surface that leads to the formation of layers of adatom islands on the tungsten surface. As the helium clusters grow into nanometer sized bubbles, their proximity to the surface and extremely high gas pressures can cause them to rupture the surface thus enabling helium release. Helium bubble bursting induces additional surface damage and tungsten mass loss which varies depending on the nature of the surface. We then show tendril-like geometries have surfaces that are more resilient to helium clustering and bubble formation and rupture. Finally, the study includes hydrogen to reveal the effect of a mixed 90\%H-10\%He plasma mix on the tungsten surface. We find that hydrogen greatly affects the tungsten surface, with a near surface hydrogen saturation layer, and that helium clusters still form and are attractive trapping sites for hydrogen.Molecular dynamics simulations have also investigated the effect of sub-surface helium bubble evolution on tungsten surface morphology. The helium bubble/tungsten surface interaction has been systematically studied to determine how parameters such as bubble shape and size, temperature, tungsten surface orientation and ligament thickness above the bubble impact bubble stability and surface evolution. The tungsten surface is roughened by a combination of adatom islands, craters and pinholes. The study provides insight into the mechanisms and conditions leading to various tungsten topology changes, most notably the formation of nanoscale fuzz.An atomistic study of the mechanisms behind initial phases of tungsten nano-fuzz growth has determined that tungsten surfaces are affected by sub-displacement energy helium and hydrogen fluxes through a series of mechanisms. Sub-surface helium atom clustering, bubble nucleation, growth and rupture lead to tungsten surface deformation. Helium clustering processes vary near grain boundaries or in tendril-like surface geometries. In the presence of hydrogen, these mechanisms are coupled with hydrogen surface saturation. Finally, further investigation to connect these atomistic mechanisms to nano-size tungsten fuzz growth is needed to get a comprehensive under- standing of the effects of low energy helium and hydrogen on tungsten.},

These helium clusters are attracted to tungsten surfaces due to an elastic interaction force that drives surface segregation.

These kinetic processes are responsible for important structural, morphological, and compositional features in plasma-exposed tungsten, including surface adatoms, near-surface immobile helium–vacancy complexes, and retained helium content. Detailed results are presented for di-helium and tri-helium clusters near low-Miller-index tungsten surfaces.},

This analysis has identified a dimensionless parameter, PΔ, which is a balance of the reaction and diffusion actions of insoluble He in a metal matrix and which governs the self-trapping effects of He into growing bubbles within a tendril. The impact of He self-trapping, as well as trapping caused by pre-existing traps in the form of lattice defects or clusters of impurities, within a half-space domain results in the formation of a densely packed layer of nanometer-sized bubbles with high number density. This prediction is consistent with available experimental observations in which a dense zone of helium bubbles is observed in tungsten, which are compared to estimates of the layer characteristics. Direct numerical simulation of the reaction–diffusion cluster dynamics supports the analysis presented here.},

Density Functional Theory (DFT) atomistic calculations [1] were used to obtain the properties of He and He-vacancy clusters, and the Binary Collision Approximation based code MARLOWE was applied to determine the damage and He-ion depth profiles as in [2], [3]. The processes involved in the homogeneous He bubble nucleation and growth were defined and implemented in the Object Kinetic Monte Carlo code LAKIMOCA [4]. In particular as the He to dpa ratio was high, self-trapping of He clusters and the trap mutation of He-vacancy clusters had to be taken into account. With this multiscale approach, the formation of bubbles was modeled up to nanometer-scale size, where bubbles can be observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Their densities and sizes were studied as functions of fluence (up to 5×1019He/m2) at two temperatures (473 and 723K) and for different sample thicknesses (25–250nm). It appears that the damage is not only due to the collision cascades but is also strongly controlled by the He accumulation in pressurized bubbles. Comparison with experimental data is discussed and sensible agreement is achieved.},

These methods excel at modeling nucleation, but often require too many equations to successfully model the long term growth and coarsening that govern microstructural evolution. One solution to this problem is to group equations into a coarser approximation of the cluster size distribution function which can reduce the cost of solution by many orders of magnitude. While such grouping methods have been advanced for a limited class of problems, no reliable method currently exists for the general case. This paper advances a framework for grouping arbitrary cluster dynamics problems, and develops several competing schemes based on that framework. These schemes are each evaluated against a variety of test problems designed to assess their accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is a promising plasma facing material for fusion reactors. Despite many favorable properties, helium ions incoming from the plasma are known to dramatically affect the microstructure of tungsten, leading to bubble growth, blistering, and/or to the formation of fuzz. In order to develop mitigation strategies, it is essential to understand the atomistic processes that lead to bubble formation and subsequent microstructural changes. In this work, we use large-scale Accelerated Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate small (N = 1,2) V N He M vacancy/helium complexes, which serve as the nuclei for larger helium bubble growth, over timescales reaching into the milliseconds under conditions typical of the operation of fusion reactors. These complexes can interconvert between different I L V N+L He M variants via Frenkel pair nucleation (leading to the creation of a additional vacancy/interstitial pair) and annihilation events; sequences of these events can lead to net migration of these embryonic bubbles. The competition between nucleation and annihilation produces a very complex dependence of the diffusivity on the number of heliums. Finally, through cluster dynamics simulations, we show that diffusion of these complexes provides an efficient pathway for helium release at fluxes expected in fusion reactors, and hence that accounting for the mobility of these complexes is crucial.},

Such vacancy concentrations far exceed thermodynamic equilibrium values but are consistent with supersaturated concentrations expected during concurrent, or preexisting, neutron irradiation. The thermodynamics and kinetic parameters to describe helium diffusion and clustering are input to KSOME based on values obtained from atomistic simulation results. These kinetic Monte Carlo results clearly delineate two different regimes of helium cluster nucleation, one dominated by helium self-trapping at high implantation rates and lower temperatures and one where helium–vacancy trapping dominates the helium cluster nucleation at lower implantation rates and higher temperatures. The transition between these regimes has been mapped as a function of implantation rate, temperature, and vacancy concentration and can provide guidance to understand the conditions under which neutron irradiation effects may contribute to subsurface gas nucleation in tungsten plasma-facing components.},

	abstract = {We present a comparison between a continuum-scale drift-diffusion-reaction cluster dynamics prediction of helium retention in low-energy helium plasma exposed tungsten and experimental measurements, in a temperature regime that did not produce tungsten fuzz. Our cluster dynamics model, Xolotl, has been successfully benchmarked to high helium implantation flux MD simulations at relatively low implanted fluence. In this article, we also describe the extension of the Xolotl DDR model to incorporate the effect of bubble bursting, which is observed in very high rate MD simulations, as well as MD simulations at longer times than simulated in our prior benchmarking comparison. The bursting model parameters have been tuned by comparing to MD simulations at a flux of 5.0 × 1027 m−2 s−1, and also compared to lower implanted fluence simulations performed at 4.0 × 1025 m−2 s−1. This article then reports on the consistency of the Xolotl predictions with respect to the size of the simulated cluster phase space (i.e. the maximum cluster size), initial vacancy concentration, and bubble growth trajectory (maximum number of helium atoms per vacancy). Finally, our simulation results are compared to helium plasma experiments that did not produce fuzz. While the Xolotl predictions including bubble bursting are in quantitative agreement with high-flux MD simulations, the initial comparison to plasma exposure experiments at a flux on the order of 1021 m−2 s−1 disagree by more than an order of magnitude, and in fact cannot reproduce the trends in helium retention with varying exposure temperature. Modifying the initial vacancy concentrations and helium cluster diffusion behavior in Xolotl leads to a reasonable agreement with the experimental observations, although the underlying physical explanation for these modifications remains unclear. The predicted helium content at experimentally relevant fluxes has been shown to be relatively insensitive to the parameters used in the bubble bursting model implemented in Xolotl, although these parameters have a larger influence at higher flux. More systematic comparisons between the modeling predictions with both experiments and MD simulation results is expected to improve the bubble bursting model in Xolotl in the future.},

With simulation times on the order of 1 μs, these results serve to discover the mechanisms involved in surface evolution as well as to serve as benchmarks for coarse-grained simulations such as kinetic Monte Carlo and continuum-scale drift–reaction–diffusion cluster dynamics simulations. The findings of our large-scale simulations are significant due to diminished finite-size effects and the longer times reached (corresponding to higher fluences). Specifically, our findings are drastically different from findings published previously in the literature for (001) surfaces under a helium flux of Γ ∼ 1028 m−2 s−1, which is typical of smaller size and shorter time atomistic simulations. In particular, this study highlights the atomic-scale materials processes relevant to helium entrapment and transport in metals, which have implications not only for nuclear fusion–relevant processes, but also helium-induced embrittlement in irradiated materials such as hospital equipment and fission reactor materials.},

We concluded that MD reproduces the experimentally found square root of time dependence of the surface growth. The He atomic density decreases when increasing the number of He atoms in the cell. A higher temperature causes a larger bubble growth and desorption activity, specially for the pure He irradiation cases. It also it leads to W recrystallization for the He+C irradiation cases. Carbon acts as a local He trap for small clusters or single atoms and causes a larger loss of crystallinity of the W surface.},

	abstract = {We investigate helium flux effects on helium transport and surface evolution in plasma-facing tungsten using molecular dynamics. The simulations span two orders of magnitude, from ITER-relevant levels to those more typical of simulations published to date. Simulation times of up to 2.5 µs (corresponding to actual fluences of m−2) are achieved, revealing concerted bubble-bursting events that are responsible for significant and very sudden changes in surface morphology. The depth distribution of helium depends very strongly on helium flux: helium self-trapping becomes more probable near the surface at high flux, and a layer of near-surface bubbles forms. Helium retention prior to the onset of bubble bursting is also substantially lower at low flux than it is at high flux. Surface features at low fluence are correlated with the positions of bubbles, but at high fluence, bubbles tend to coalesce, venting to the surface at one or more locations and leaving large interconnected cavities below the surface. Ruptured bubbles may serve as pathways deeper into the material, allowing helium to bypass the layer of near-surface bubbles and fill deeper, potentially much larger, bubbles that can produce more substantial surface features. Deeper bubbles also emit prismatic dislocation loops that can fill in cavities closer to the surface. Our results suggest that nearly all molecular dynamics simulations published to date are hampered by finite-size effects, and that helium flux is a very important parameter in determining the behavior of helium in plasma-facing components.},

The emphasis is put on the appropriate description of the helium-metal repulsion, which can be modelled as a variable-size gap between regions occupied by helium and metal atoms. Each contribution to the bubble energy is parametrized on MD calculations performed in iron. The model is shown to reproduce accurately the dissociation energies obtained by MD over a large range of helium-to-vacancy ratios. Improvements over previous models are shown on a few equilibrium properties: binding energies, solid to fluid transition, helium density in bubbles and validity of Laplace law. Beyond the iron case, such a model should be valid in other metals where helium behavior is similar.},

	abstract = {In fusion reactors, plasma facing components (PFC) and, in particular, the divertor will be irradiated with high fluxes of low-energy (∼100 eV) helium and hydrogen ions. Tungsten is one of the leading candidate divertor materials for ITER and DEMO fusion reactors. However, the behaviour of tungsten under high dose, coupled helium/hydrogen exposure remains to be fully understood. The PFC response and performance changes are intimately related to microstructural changes, such as the formation of point defect clusters, helium and hydrogen bubbles or dislocation loops. Computational materials' modelling results are described here that investigate the mechanisms controlling microstructural evolution in tungsten. The aim of this study is to understand and predict sub-surface helium bubble growth under high flux helium ion implantation (∼1022 m−2 s−1) at high temperatures ({\textgreater}1000 K). We report results from a spatially dependent cluster dynamics model based on reaction–diffusion rate theory to describe the evolution of the microstructure under these conditions. The key input parameters to the model (diffusion coefficients, migration and binding energies, initial defect production) are determined from a combination of atomistic modelling and available experimental data. The results are in good agreement with results of an analytical model that is presented in a separate paper. In particular, it is found that the sub-surface evolution with respect to bubble size and concentration of the helium bubbles strongly depends on the flux and temperature.},

On the one hand, we show a strong attraction between H and He in W originated from the charge density redistribution due to the presence of He, driving H segregation towards He. This can block the permeation of H into deeper bulk and thus suppress H blistering. On the other hand, we demonstrate that He, rather than H, energetically prefers to occupy the vacancy centre due to its closed-shell structure, which can block H2 formation at the vacancy centre. This is because He causes a redistribution of charge density inside the vacancy to make it ‘not optimal’ for the formation of H2 molecules, which can be treated as a preliminary nucleation of the H bubbles. We thus propose that H retention and blistering in W can be suppressed by doping the noble gas elements.},

The proposed formalization is available for evaluating both microstructural changes in fusion first wall materials where helium is produced by (n, α) nuclear transmutation reactions, and those in fusion diverter materials where helium particles with low energy are directly implanted. The calculated nucleation barrier is significantly reduced by the presence of helium, showing that a helium bubble with an appropriate number of helium atoms depending on bubble size can nucleate without any large nucleation barriers, even at a condition where an empty void has very large nucleation barriers without helium. With the proposed thermodynamic formalization, the nucleation and growth process of helium bubbles in iron during irradiation is simulated by the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) technique. It shows the nucleation path of a helium bubble on the (N He, N V) space as functions of temperatures and the concentration of helium in the matrix, where N He and N V are the numbers of helium atoms and vacancies contained in the helium bubble, respectively. Bubble growth rates depend on the nucleation path and suggest that two different mechanisms operate for bubble growth: one is controlled by vacancy diffusion and the other is controlled by interstitial helium diffusion.},

The binding enthalpies determined for the pure metals are in excellent agreement with mechanistic calculations based on effective medium theory and other information. Surface-limited release of deuterium from iron, stainless steel and Inconel was measured as a function of temperature and the state of surface oxidation. The release rate was accurately proportional to the square of the deuterium concentration in solution, permitting the results to be expressed in terms of a surface recombination coefficient. This quantity was up to four orders of magnitude greater for an ion-sputtered surface than for a surface with electropolish oxide. The diffusion coefficient and solid solubility of tritium in stainless steel were measured for the first time at the ice point, thereby extending downward by three orders of magnitude the diffusivities available from conventional permeation experiments. Deuterium concentration profiles resulting from electrochemical charging of Incology 903 were measured as a function of charging current, thereby providing a direct systematic calibration of such charging in an austenitic material where conventional permeation measurements are precluded by the small hydrogen diffusion rate.},

Interaction of plasma components with the material is unavoidable and will lead to degradation of the performance and the lifetime of the in-vessel components.

In this work we study migration, stability and self-trapping properties of pure helium and mixed helium-hydrogen clusters in tungsten by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We test two versions of an embedded atom model interatomic potential by comparing it with ab initio data regarding the binding properties of He clusters. By analysing the trajectories of the clusters during molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures we obtain the diffusion parameters. The results show that the diffusivity of mixed clusters is significantly lower, than that of pure helium clusters. The latter suggest that the formation of mixed clusters during mixed hydrogen helium plasma exposure will affect the helium diffusivity in the material.},

	abstract = {Tungsten has been chosen as the divertor armour material in ITER and is the main candidate material for plasma-facing components for future fusion reactors. Interaction of plasma components with the material leads to degradation of the performance and thus the lifetime of the in-vessel components. On top of that special attention is drawn to tritium retention in the reactors vessel from a safety point of view, since tritium is radioactive material. In order to gain better understanding of the mechanisms driving accumulation of plasma components in the material and subsequent degradation of the material, atomistic simulations are employed. The focus of this work is on so-called self trapping of H and He atoms or, in other words, Frenkel pair formation in bulk tungsten in the presence of H and He atoms. Two versions of a model embedded atom interatomic potential and a bond order potential were tested by comparing it with ab initio data regarding the binding properties of pure He and He-H-Vacancy clusters and energetics of Frenkel pair formation. As a result of Molecular Dynamics simulations at finite temperature, the values of critical H concentration needed for the generation of a Frenkel pair in the presence of He clusters were obtained. The results show that the critical H concentration decreases with the size of He cluster present in the simulation cell and thus, Frenkel pair formation by H is facilitated in the presence of He clusters in the material.},

	abstract = {Tritium (T) implanted by plasmas diffuses into bulk material, especially rapidly at elevated temperatures, and becomes trapped in neutron radiation-induced defects in materials that act as trapping sites for the tritium. The trapped tritium atoms will decay to produce helium-3 (3He) atoms at a half-life of 12.3 years. 3He has a large cross section for absorbing thermal neutrons, which after absorbing a neutron produces hydrogen (H) and tritium ions with a combined kinetic energy of 0.76 MeV through the 3He(n,H)T nuclear reaction. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the 3He produced in tungsten by tritium decay compared to the neutron-induced helium-4 (4He) produced in tungsten. This is important given the fact that helium in materials not only creates microstructural damage in the bulk of the material but alters surface morphology of the material effecting plasma-surface interaction process (e.g. material evolution, erosion and tritium behavior) of plasma-facing component materials. Effects of tritium decay 3He in tungsten are investigated here with a simple model that predicts quantity of 3He produced in a fusion DEMO FW based on a neutron energy spectrum found in literature. This study reveals that: (1) helium-3 concentration was equilibrated to ∼6\% of initial/trapped tritium concentration, (2) tritium concentration remained approximately constant (94\% of initial tritium concentration), and (3) displacement damage from 3He(n,H)T nuclear reaction became {\textgreater}1 dpa/year in DEMO FW.},

We show a strong attraction between H and He in both systems that drives H segregation towards He. The substitutional He and tetrahedral interstitial H defects in W-Ta alloy are more energetically favorable than pure W due to the decreased electronic density of the replaced Ta atom. Moreover, 1 He-Vac complex in both systems can trap as many as 12 H atoms. Based on the calculated formation energy of Hn-He-Vac complexes, the H3-He-Vac has the lowest formation energy in both systems.

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H) trapping by helium-vacancy (HeV) complexes in bulk and the near surface region of tungsten (W) have been investigated by molecular statics calculations that evaluate two different WH interatomic potentials, which use the same WHe, HeHe and HeH potentials. One of the WH potentials is a bond-order potential (BOP) developed by Juslin et al., while the other is an embedding atom method (EAM) potential developed by Wang et al.. Both potentials overestimate the H binding energies to He clusters in bulk W, as compared to DFT calculations, but properly predict the functional form of the H binding energies to He clusters with increasing number of He and H. The BOP simulations reveal that H binding energies to HexV complexes generally increase with increasing number of He. However, the EAM results indicate that the H binding energy as a function of number of He depends on the number of H, and the H binding energies change slightly at high He content. Compared with available DFT data, both BOP and EAM underestimate the H binding energies to HexV2Hm complexes. The BOP reproduces the He formation energy below a W surface, while the EAM potential better reproduces the H formation energy and the interactions between H and HeV complexes. Based on these comparisons, we determine that the EAM potential is more accurate than BOP for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of WHeH interactions. The EAM potential predicts that the difference in the average binding energies of H to stable HeV complexes near the W surface is less than 0.2 eV and the difference decreases with increasing He content. Thus, the EAM potential indicates that the effect of surfaces on H binding energies to large HeV complexes below the W surfaces can be ignored.},

For this purpose, coarse-grained and nanostructured W samples were sequentially irradiated with carbon (C) and H ions at energies of 665 keV and 170 keV, respectively. A first set of the implanted samples was annealed at 473 K and a second set at 573 K. Object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed to account for experimental outcomes. Results show that the number of vacancies for nanostructured W is always larger than for monocrystalline W samples in the whole studied temperature range and that the number of vacancies is only reduced in samples with a large density of grain boundaries and at temperatures high enough to activate the vacancy motion (around 573 K). Results also indicate that the migration of H along vacancy free grain boundaries is more effective than along the bulk, and that the retained H is trapped in vacancies located within the grains. These results are used to explain the experimental outcomes.},

The reason for this discrepancy is the high propensity for He to form He-He clusters characterized by a very large binding energy of the order of 1 eV.

The subsurface hydrogen concentration is calculated given a flux of hydrogen, a temperature of implantation, and the energy of the incoming hydrogen ions as independent variables. This global model is built step by step; an equilibrium between atomic hydrogen within bulk tungsten and a molecular hydrogen gas phase is first considered, and the calculated solubility is compared with experimental results. Subsequently, a kinetic model is used to determine the chemical potential for hydrogen in the subsurface of tungsten. Combining both these models, two regimes are established in which hydrogen is preferentially trapped either at interstitial sites or in vacancies. We deduce from our model that the existence of these two regimes is driven by the temperature of the implanted tungsten sample; above a threshold or transition temperature is the interstitial regime, and below is the vacancy regime in which supersaturated layers form within tenths of an angstrom below the surface. A simple analytical expression is derived for the coexistence of the two regimes depending on the implantation temperature, the incident energy, and the flux of the hydrogen ions which we use to plot the corresponding phase diagram.},

After a short discussion suggestive of a heuristic model for predicting the associated energy and the heat of transport, data from several experiments are analyzed to show that the simplistic model works reasonably well with endothermic materials such as Fe and Ni, but is less successful with hydride formers. The implications of the model for tritium permeation and retention are discussed, and sample calculations are presented to illustrate the importance of properly accounting for the Soret effect in predicting tritium permeation and retention in fusion reactor structures. Neglecting the Soret effect may result in order of magnitude errors in estimating permeation and retention, while accounting for temperature sensitivity in the heat of transport will result in less significant corrections. An Appendix summarizes the development of transport equations from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to clarify the relationships between the various transport parameters involved.},

	abstract = {Surface morphology and deuterium retention in tungsten oxide layers (WO3−z, z⩽0.25) grown on polycrystalline and recrystallized W substrates have been examined after exposure to a low-energy (38eV/D), high flux (1022D/m2s) D plasma to an ion fluence of 1026D/m2 at various temperatures (up to ∼700K). Characterization methods used were scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, and the D(3He,p)4He nuclear reaction analysis. During exposure to the D plasma at temperatures of 340–615K, a partial reduction of the tungsten oxide takes place in the near-surface layer up to 0.3μm in depth. Even at around room temperature, deuterium atoms diffuse several micrometers into the tungsten oxide. The high D concentration of about 0.1D/W observed in the first micrometers below the surface at temperatures below 500K can be related mainly to D atoms chemically bonded to O atoms. As the exposure temperature increases, the D concentration decreases, reaching about 2×10−4D/W at 615K. At plasma exposure temperatures of about 700K, the oxide layer shrinks and loses a large fraction of oxygen.},

WO3 films (350nm) covered by W layers (200nm) were deposited on SiO2 glass substrates by sputtering in a mixture of Ar and O2 gases. The hydrogen concentration in the WO3 film was characterized by elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). The hydrogen concentration in the WO3 film increased by 0.4 H/W in proportion to the fluence of the H2+ ions implanted into the W layer. The optical absorption coefficient of the film at 750nm increased linearly by 3μm−1 with an increase in the concentration of the implanted hydrogen up to 0.1 H/W, and saturated at 4μm−1 with the concentration higher than 0.1 H/W. These results indicate that the introduced hydrogen up to a hydrogen concentration of 0.1 H/W can be monitored by measuring the optical absorbance in the WO3 films.},

	abstract = {For the future fusion demonstration power plant, DEMO, several blanket designs are currently under consideration. Despite geometric and operational differences, all designs suggest a first wall (FW), in which tungsten (W) armour is joined to a structure made of Reduced Activation Ferritic Martensitic (RAFM) steel. In thermo-mechanical analyses of breeding blankets, this joint has received limited attention. In order to provide a basis for better understanding of thermally induced stresses and strains in the FW, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a water-cooled test component is explored in the current contribution. The model aims at providing a simple geometry that allows straightforward comparison of numerical and experimental results, while trying to keep boundary conditions as realistic as possible. A test component with direct RAFM steel-W joint, and a test component with a stress-redistributing, functionally graded RAFM steel/W interlayer in the joint is considered in the current contribution. The analyses take production- and operation-related loads into account. Following a detailed analysis of the evolution of stress components and strain in the model, a parameter study with respect to geometric specifications and loads is presented. The analyses show that, even in a small test component, a direct RAFM steel-W joint causes enormous plastic deformation. The implementation of a functionally graded interlayer reduces stresses and strains significantly, but vertical normal stresses at the joint's circumference remain considerable. With the component geometry considered here, the graded interlayer should be at least 1 mm thick and contain 4 sublayers to appropriately redistribute stresses. Beyond a component width of 14 mm, stresses increase strongly, which may pose a risk to the applicability of large-scale FW components, too.},

FESTIM has been validated by reproducing experimental data and the Method of Manufactured Solutions was used for analytical verification. Following relevant plasma scenarios, both transient heat transfer and hydrogen isotopes (HIs) diffusion have been simulated in order to assess HIs retention in monoblocks. Relevant materials properties have been used. Each plasma cycle is composed of a current ramp up, a current plateau, a current ramp down and a resting phase before the following shot. 100 cycles are simulated. The total HIs inventory in the tokamak during resting phases reaches 1.8×10−3mg whereas during the implantation phases it keeps increasing as a power law of time. Particle flux on the cooling channel of the monoblock is also computed. The breakthrough time is estimated to be t=1×105s which corresponds to 24 cycles. Relevance of 2D modelling has been demonstrated by comparing the total HIs inventory obtained by 2D and 1D simulations. Using 1D simulations, a relative error is observed compared to 2D simulations which can reach -25\% during the resting phase. The error during implantation phases keeps increasing.},

In previous papers, it has been shown that plasma facing components are prone to crack, appearing in tungsten block during thermal cyclic heat loading. In order to predict component lifetime, a numerical simulation is proposed in this paper. With regard to previous studies, tungsten (raw and recrystallized) real mechanical behaviors are taken into account. To be used as inputs for numerical simulations, compressive tests at different temperatures and strain rates were realized on raw and recrystallized tungsten. Raw tungsten tests reveal a linear elastic and ideal plastic behavior that is sensitive to strain rate. Concerning recrystallized tungsten, an elastic-viscoplastic behavior is observed on the entire explored temperature range (up to 1150 °C), that can be described by an elastic-plastic model with kinematic hardening. Manson-Coffin relationships are used to estimate the lifetime. When taking into account real mechanical behaviors for raw tungsten and recrystallized tungsten, we show that lifetime estimation is mainly driven by recrystallized thickness in the component, by the ductile to brittle transition temperature and finally by strain rate.},

An extensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been performed at 933 K and/or 1200 K to determine the probabilities of desorption and modified trap mutation that occurs as small, mobile Hen (1 ≤ n ≤ 7) clusters diffuse from the near-surface region toward surfaces of varying crystallographic orientation due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. These near-surface cluster dynamics have significant effects on the surface morphology, the near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure, for which we have developed an extensive MD database of cumulative evolution during high-flux helium implantation at 933 K, which we compare to our properly parameterized cluster-dynamics model.

	abstract = {Dans ce travail, nous étudions la stabilité thermique et les effets des irradiations par un plasma d'hélium ou de deutérium de films minces de WO3 d’intérêt pour la fusion magnétique (projet ITER). L’objectif est de comprendre comment une oxydation du divertor modifie les interactions plasma paroi. Pour cela, nous avons synthétisé des films de WO3 par oxydation thermique de substrats de W à 400°C et caractérisé les effets du type de substrat, de la pression d’oxygène et du temps d’oxydation sur la structure et sur l’épaisseur des oxydes formés. La structure (monoclinique nanocristalline), la morphologie et les défauts des échantillons ont été analysés avant et après traitement, à différentes échelles, en utilisant la microscopie électronique, la microscopie Raman, la diffraction de rayons X, et la microscopie à force atomique.Le chauffage sous vide (400 - 800°C) a conduit à la formation de WO2. Le bombardement aux ions D+ (11 eV) a mené à une diffusion profonde du deutérium à travers le film d’oxyde, engendrant un effet électrochimique, observé ici pour la première fois sous irradiation plasma. Cet effet, réversible, est associé à la formation de bronzes de tungstène (DxWO3) et à une transition de phase vers une structure hexagonale. Des bombardements aux ions He+ (20 eV) ont été réalisés afin de dissocier les effets physiques et chimiques. A température ambiante, le bombardement a causé peu de changements morphologiques et structuraux. Par contre, le autre bombardement à 400°C a causé une érosion du film d’oxyde accompagnée d’un changement de couleur, une amorphisation en surface et la formation de bulles à l’interface W / WO3.},

	abstract = {Next-step fusion nuclear devices require plasma-facing components that can survive a much higher neutron dose than ITER, and in many design concepts also require higher operating temperatures, higher reliability, and materials with more attractive safety and environmental characteristics. In search of first wall concepts that can withstand surface heat fluxes beyond 2 MW/m, we analyzed advanced “monoblock” designs using coolants and materials that offer more attractive long-term performance. These use tungsten armor and heat sinks, similar to previous designs, but replace the coolant with helium and the coolant containment pipe with either low-activation ferritic-martensitic steel or SiC/SiC composite. The results of analysis show that helium-cooled steel can remove up to 5 MW/m of steady-state surface heat flux and helium-cooled SiC/SiC can remove nearly 10 MW/m while satisfying all materials and design requirements. This suggests that a He-cooled W/SiC monoblock could withstand divertor-like heat fluxes.},

The target plate of the divertor is directly exposed to non-uniform high heat flux on the surface by particle bombardment and radiation. In the case of ITER and a DEMO reactor, the peak surface heat flux is expected to reach up to 10MW/m2 during normal operation and 20MW/m2 during slow transient events like loss of plasma detachment. This paper reports the results of a preliminary code-based design study and fabrication technology verification test which were conducted for developing an ITER-like divertor target design for the DEMO divertor. The structural failure evaluation against the ratchetting and fatigue criteria of the ITER SDC-IC showed that the design with reduced dimensions would allow sufficient design margin (reserve factor) for three distinct thermal loading cases. The first trial of mock-up fabrication using a new joining furnace at ENEA was successfully completed. The ultrasonic inspection test made before and after the cyclic HHF tests at GLADIS facility demonstrated high quality of fabrication and robust design concept.},

It is shown that H-vacancy and He-vacancy clusters are weaker traps for He and H single atoms, respectively, as compared to a single vacancy. H or He atom, solely, is strongly attracted to the studied grain boundary interfaces, while the mutual H-He interaction is negligible (close to the interaction in vacuum) if both atoms are placed in the adjacent trapping sites located on the grain boundary. The H-He pair placed in the core of the screw or edge dislocation exhibits the binding energy of {\textasciitilde}0.2–0.3 eV, which is close to the H-He attraction in the bulk W. The ground-state configurations for H-He dimers located in various lattice defects in W were rationalized on the basis of atomic structure visualizations, bond analysis and charge density distributions. The obtained data are discussed in the frame of the thermal desorption spectroscopy results offering a better understanding of the detrapping stages of He and H isotopes under mixed plasma exposure conditions.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in tritium transport modeling of helium-cooled ceramic breeding blankets systems has shined light into some tritium management issues. A detailed component model accounting for multi-physics, design, and operational features is necessary to provide accurate estimations of tritium permeation rates to the building/environment- a safety and licensing concern for a fusion nuclear reactor. We found that tritium permeation to buildings can be reduced of ∼20 times when H2 is increased from ∼0.2 Pa to 100 Pa in coolant streams due to the effect of H and T co-permeation. Similarly, the practice of adding about 0.1 \% vol of H2 into the helium purge gas to promote tritium release can also reduce permeation from breeding zones to coolant systems. However, high H2 partial pressure in helium purge gas further complicates tritium extraction methodology, and may compromise extraction efficiency. This paper provides a concentrated analysis of tritium management in the He-cooled ceramic blankets with the goal of providing further outer fuel cycle tritium R\&D guidance from an integrated point of view.},

As well as producing defects, the neutrons bombarding the materials initiate nuclear reactions, leading to transmutation of the elemental atoms. Products of many of these reactions are gases, particularly helium, which can cause swelling and embrittlement of materials. This paper integrates several different computational techniques to produce a comprehensive picture of the response of materials to neutron irradiation, enabling the assessment of structural integrity of components in a fusion power plant. Neutron-transport calculations for a model of the next-step fusion device DEMO reveal the variation in exposure conditions in different components of the vessel, while inventory calculations quantify the associated implications for transmutation and gas production. The helium production rates are then used, in conjunction with a simple model for He-induced grain-boundary embrittlement based on electronic-structure density functional theory calculations, to estimate the timescales for susceptibility to grain-boundary failure in different fusion-relevant materials. There is wide variation in the predicted grain-boundary-failure lifetimes as a function of both microstructure and chemical composition, with some conservative predictions indicating much less than the required lifetime for components in a fusion power plant.},

Many of these reactions produce gases, particularly helium, which cause additional swelling and embrittlement of materials. This paper investigates, using a combination of neutron-transport and inventory calculations, the variation in displacements per atom (dpa) and helium production levels as a function of position within the high flux regions of a recent conceptual model for the ‘next-step’ fusion device DEMO. Subsequently, the gas production rates are used to provide revised estimates, based on new density-functional-theory results, for the critical component lifetimes associated with the helium-induced grain-boundary embrittlement of materials. The revised estimates give more optimistic projections for the lifetimes of materials in a fusion power plant compared to a previous study, while at the same time indicating that helium embrittlement remains one of the most significant factors controlling the structural integrity of fusion power plant components.},

Before bubble rupture occurs, stepped, thin schistose and pyramidal structures are observed on the (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, respectively. When the angle between the normal direction of surface and the sliding direction (〈1 1 1〉 direction) is larger, flatter surface would be formed and the subsequent release process would be more violent. In the bursting process, the release rate of helium and the degree of surface damage are correlated with the surface stacking height before bubble bursts. Unrepaired crack structures have been observed on the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces, while a smaller hole on the (1 1 1) surface. The stacking atoms have a tendency to make the surface restore to the bcc structure. At high temperature, the surface pore with radius ∼1 nm can be self-healed from outer to inner by the diffusion of surface atoms, while no recovery is observed in MD time scale when the ratio of He/V in the bubble is high.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a finite element formulation for solving coupled mechanical/diffusion problems. In particular, we study hydrogen diffusion in metals and its impact on their mechanical behaviour (i.e. hydrogen embrittlement). The formulation can be used to model hydrogen diffusion through a material and its accumulation within different microstructural features of the material (dislocations, precipitates, interfaces, etc.). Further, the effect of hydrogen on the plastic response and cohesive strength of different interfaces can be incorporated. The formulation adopts a standard Galerkin method in the discretisation of both the diffusion and mechanical equilibrium equations. Thus, a displacement-based finite element formulation with chemical potential as an additional degree of freedom, rather than the concentration, is employed. Consequently, the diffusion equation can be expressed fundamentally in terms of the gradient in chemical potential, which reduces the continuity requirements on the shape functions to zero degree, \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\}\_\{0\}\$\$C0, i.e. linear functions, compared to the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\}\_\{1\}\$\$C1continuity condition required when concentration is adopted. Additionally, a consistent interface element formulation can be achieved due to the continuity of the chemical potential across the interface—concentration can be discontinuous at an interface which can lead to numerical problems. As a result, the coding of the FE equations is more straightforward. The details of the physical problem, the finite element formulation and constitutive models are initially discussed. Numerical results for various example problems are then presented, in which the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation are explored and a comparison with the concentration-based formulations is presented.},

The temperature gradient resulting from a steady state heat load of 10 MWm−2 along the monoblock depth is considered and its influence on the evolution of defects is discussed. The trapping of helium at vacancies and the associated formation of helium-vacancy clusters is found to be pronounced in the sub-surface layers. A significant influence of helium detrapping from grain boundaries and dislocations, along with its resolution from clusters, on the helium diffusion length scales is observed.

	abstract = {The effect of deuterium (D) presence on the amount of displacement damage created in tungsten (W) during high-energy W-ion irradiation is investigated. For this purpose, we have performed modelling of experimental results where W was sequentially or simultaneously irradiated by 10.8 MeV W ions and exposed to 300 eV D ions. A novel displacement damage creation and stabilization model was newly developed and introduced into the MHIMS-Reservoir (migration of hydrogen isotopes in materials) code. It employs macroscopic rate equations (MREs) for solving the evolution of solute and trapped D concentrations in the material. The new displacement damage creation and stabilization model is based on spontaneous recombination of Frenkel pairs and stabilization of defects that are occupied by D atoms. By using the new model, we could successfully replicate the measured D depth profiles and D thermal desorption data, where a higher defect concentration was observed when D was present during W irradiation as compared to when no D was present. For this we utilized parameters, which include the number of distinct defect types, the de-trapping energies of their fill-levels, their saturation concentrations and their probability for stabilization if they contain a D during the W-ion irradiation. To successfully replicate the experimental results three distinct defect types were needed with several fill-levels. By comparing the de-trapping energies of the defect fill-levels with data available from the literature, the defect types were identified as single-vacancies, small vacancy clusters and large vacancy clusters. The effect of D presence was found to be largest in single vacancies as its concentration increased by about a factor of three, while the concentration of small vacancy clusters increased by about a factor of two. Large vacancy clusters were found to be largely unaffected as they showed very little increase in concentration when D was present.},

Here, focusing on tungsten as a model body-centred cubic system, we explicitly demonstrate sequential adsorption of hydrogen adatoms on Wigner–Seitz squares of nanovoids with distinct energy levels. Interaction between hydrogen adatoms on nanovoid surfaces is shown to be dominated by pairwise power-law repulsion. We establish a predictive model for quantitative determination of the configurations and energetics of hydrogen adatoms in nanovoids. This model, combined with the equation of states of hydrogen gas, enables the prediction of hydrogen molecule formation in nanovoids. Multiscale simulations, performed based on our model, show good agreement with recent thermal desorption experiments. This work clarifies fundamental physics and provides a full-scale predictive model for hydrogen trapping and bubbling in nanovoids, offering long-sought mechanistic insights that are crucial for understanding hydrogen-induced damage in structural materials.},

As part of the lengthy process which should lead to mastering nuclear fusion, different fusion facility projects are currently under study throughout the world to be ready to continue building on the work which will take place in the ITER facility. On the basis of the experience acquired during the ITER safety expertise, the IRSN has carried out a preliminary study of the safety issues which seem necessary to take into account right from the earliest design phase of these DEMO facilities. The issues studied have included the decay heat removal, exposure to ionizing radiation, potential accidents, and effluent releases and waste. The study shows that it will be important to give priority to the following actions, given that their results would have a major influence on the design: assess if decay heat removal is a safety function, re-study the accidents considered in the context of the ITER project and identify those specific to DEMO, and optimize each of the main routes for gaseous tritium releases.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen in metals attracts interest from scientists since many decades. Most of the interesting properties are related to the small size of hydrogen: its interstitial diffusion accompanied by quantum mechanical tunnel transport results in an extraordinary high mobility of hydrogen atoms in materials. For metals, H diffusivity may reach values as known for ions in aqueous solutions. Thus, thermodynamic equilibrium is reached within comparably short times even at room temperature. Therefore, metal–hydrogen systems are often used as model systems to study physical or chemical properties and their change with concentration (see, for example Oates and Flanagan, 1981, 1981a or Pundt and Kirchheim (2006)). In 1937, Lacher (1937) already used Pd–H (Flanagan and Oates, 1981, 1991) to study solute–solute interactions and interpreted it in the framework of a quasi-chemical approach (Lacher, 1937). The quantum mechanical tunneling as a diffusion mechanism also for atoms in solids was first discovered and discussed for hydrogen tunneling in metals (Flynn and Stoneham, 1970; Völk and Alefeld, 1975; Birnbaum and Flynn, 1976). Völk and Alefeld (1978), Zabel and Peisl (1979, 1980), and Steyrer and Peisl (1986) studied hydrogen density modulations that are related to the sample geometry; and Zabel and his colleagues, as published by Miceli et al. (1985), Uher et al. (1987), Song et al. (1996, 2000), and Uher et al. (1987), firstly used metal–hydrogen systems to study the behavior of systems with reduced dimensions and modulated hydrogen affinity. Kirchheim (1988) and colleagues extensively studied metal–hydrogen systems as representative for solute/solvent systems. The high mobility of hydrogen further allows studying the impact of defects that usually annihilate at elevated temperatures, see Gottstein (2001). It was, therefore, suggested to use hydrogen as a probe for defects (Cahn, 1990; Flanagan et al., 2001a, 2001b; Kirchheim, 2004) and perform site energy spectroscopy by gradually increasing the hydrogen chemical potential.},

Traps are characterized by their nature, i.e., reversible or irreversible, saturable or unsaturable. A dislocation core is a saturable, reversible trap, while voids and crack are unsaturable, reversible traps. A trap model based on saturable, reversible traps is developed, which is slightly different from the trap model of McNabb and Foster. In equilibrium, the trap model corresponds to Oriani’s trap model. Kumnick and Johnson found experimentally that the trap density increases as the plastic strain increases. Using their trap data, it is shown that equilibrium between hydrogen in lattice sites and trap sites can be assumed when strain rates are used as in standard tensile tests.},

A simple one-parameter equation of state (the Abel–Noble equation of state) is shown to capture the real gas behavior of hydrogen and its isotopes for pressures less than 200MPa and temperatures between 223 and 423K. We use the literature on hydrogen transport in austenitic stainless steels to provide general guidance on and clarification of test procedures, and to provide recommendations for appropriate permeability, diffusivity and solubility relationships for austenitic stainless steels.

Two different Ne seeded plasma backgrounds with varying sub-divertor neutral pressures but the same Ne impurity concentration are considered, representing high recycling and partially detached divertor solutions. The 2D SOLPS numerical grid does not extend all the way to the wall surfaces so that an extrapolation of the plasma background is required and is performed using a second simulation stage in which the far scrape-off layer (SOL) region is numerically gridded and plasma transport solved on the extended grid using the OSM (a 1D simplified Braginski code) approach [1]. The plasma conditions chosen for this far SOL region strongly influence the results. The hydrogenic flux is calculated from the electronic density and ion flow, the latter of which has an assumed distribution. Depending on the main-SOL plasma flow parameters and far-SOL density, fuel retention is driven by deposition on the first wall (when parallel flow through the main-SOL is switched off), or by deposition on the divertor (parallel flow through the main-SOL is switched on). When retention is dominated by deposition on the first wall, there is slightly more retention in the partially detached case compared to a high recycling scenario. In the low power cases, there is insignificant deposition and fuel retention.},

Shaping of the blanket plasma-facing wall in 3D may prove to be essential, but this strategy alone is not sufficient to protect against anticipated transient plasma events. The high heat flux wall-limiter approach used in ITER is not thought to be viable in a tritium self-sufficient power reactor, and so in EU DEMO wall protection using discrete limiters is pursued. Two types of discrete limiter are described in this paper. One is an equatorial port limiter designed to handle the power during the plasma start-up phase, making use of water-cooled tungsten/CuCrZr monoblock technology. The second is the upper limiter, featuring a plasma-facing component designed specifically for extreme transient loading due to a vertical displacement event. The heat flux channelling and thermal barrier features of this design are shown to considerably reduce CuCrZr pipe temperature, and so reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failure. A preliminary neutronic calculation has shown that the impact of these discrete limiters on overall tritium breeding ratio is relatively low.},

This is illustrated by detailed examples from computational fluid dynamics. The strength of the MMS procedure is that it can identify any coding mistake that affects the order-of-accuracy of the numerical method. A set of examples which use a blind-test protocol demonstrates the kinds of coding mistakes that can (and cannot) be exposed via the MMS code Verification procedure. The principle advantage of the MMS procedure over traditional methods of code Verification is that code capabilities are tested in full generality. The procedure thus results in a high degree of confidence that all coding mistakes which prevent the equations from being solved correctly have been identified.},

	abstract = {In this study, surface helium (He) effect on hydrogen isotopes diffusion and trapping/detrapping behavior was modelled and integrated into the HIDT simulation code. Effective dynamics properties of hydrogen in tungsten including diffusivity, solubility, recycling and diffusion barrier were considered to reflect the influence of He bubbles. Simulation results showed that total hydrogen retention was reduced with the existence of He bubbles near surface, which was consistent with the reported laboratory experimental results. It was found that the most significant influence came from the diffusion barrier induced by He bubbles. With increasing the barrier factor, total hydrogen retention changed from the tendency of decrease to increase. When the barrier factor was less than 0.3, hydrogen desorption from the implantation surface was dominant, while that from the backside surface became dominant when the barrier factor was greater than 0.4. In the meanwhile, more hydrogen accumulated beyond the He bubble layer was observed. These hydrogen atoms occupied not only in trapping sites, but also in lattice sites. Based on these findings, three desorption stages, namely surface desorption, major desorption and backside desorption, could characterize the TDS spectra with different mechanisms. In addition, our findings were further substantiated by the reported experimental data. This study provides a new perspective to reveal the surface He effect on hydrogen isotopes retention behavior in plasma facing materials.},

Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.},

	abstract = {A multiscale model of helium bubble evolution in plasma-facing materials is developed. The model links different stages of helium bubble evolution: deposition, nucleation, growth, motion, and coalescence. Helium deposition is simulated with the SRIM Monte Carlo program to give spatial information on helium and displacement damage distributions near the surface. This deposition profile is then introduced into a space-dependent rate theory of bubble nucleation and growth to describe the early stages of the distribution and size of helium bubbles. The coarsening stage of bubble evolution as a result of whole bubble motion, interaction, and coalescence is modeled by a new Object Kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) model, for which initial conditions are taken from the mean-field rate theory calculations. The model is compared to experimental data on low-energy helium plasma interaction with micro-engineered tungsten (W), and on high-energy helium ion deposition in flat W samples. Novel features of the multiscale model include: (1) space-dependent rate theory; (2) OKMC model of bubble motion in stress and temperature fields; and (3) application of the model to micro-engineered materials, and comparison with experiments on the same time-scale. At low helium ion energy, it is found that the mechanism of trap mutation is essential in achieving good agreement with experimental measurements. On the other hand, good agreement with experiments at high incident ion energy and temperature showed the importance of bubble coalescence and coarsening as main mechanisms. The results of the model are compared with experiments on flat W surfaces irradiated at high ion energy (30 keV), and with micro-engineered W, where the surface is coated with high-density micro-pillars at low ion energy (around 100 eV). The predicted average bubble radius and density are in qualitative agreement with experimental results.},

	abstract = {The tungsten (W) material in the high heat flux regions of the ITER divertor will be exposed to high fluxes of low-energy particles (e.g. H, D, T, He, Ne and/or N). Combined with long-pulse operations, this implies fluences well in excess of the highest values reached in today’s tokamak experiments. Shaping of the individual monoblock top surface and tilting of the vertical targets for leading-edge protection lead to an increased surface heat flux, and thus increased surface temperature and a reduced margin to remain below the temperature at which recrystallization and grain growth begin. Significant morphology changes are known to occur on W after exposure to high fluences of low-energy particles, be it H or He. An analysis of the formation conditions of these morphology changes is made in relation to the conditions expected at the vertical targets during different phases of operations. It is concluded that both H and He-related effects can occur in ITER. In particular, the case of He-induced nanostructure (also known as ‘fuzz’) is reviewed. Fuzz formation appears possible over a limited region of the outer vertical target, the inner target being generally a net Be deposition area. A simple analysis of the fuzz growth rate including the effect of edge-localized modes (ELMs) and the reduced thermal conductivity of fuzz shows that the fuzz thickness is likely to be limited by the occurrence of annealing during ELM-induced thermal excursions. Not only the morphology, but the material mechanical and thermal properties can be modified by plasma exposure. A review of the existing literature is made, but the existing data are insufficient to conclude quantitatively on the importance and extent of these effects for ITER. As a consequence of the high surface temperatures in ITER, W recrystallization is an important effect to consider, since it leads to a decrease in material strength. An approach is proposed here to develop an operational budget for the W material, i.e. the time the divertor material can be operated at a given temperature before a significant fraction of the material is recrystallized. In general, while it is clear that significant surface damage can occur during ITER operations, the tolerable level of damage in terms of plasma operations currently remains unknown.},

The potential is applied to assess the thermal stability of various H–He complexes of sizes too large for ab initio techniques. The results show that the dissociation of H–He clusters stabilized by vacancies will occur primarily by emission of hydrogen atoms and then by break-up of V–He complexes, indicating that H–He interaction does influence the release of hydrogen.},

We have grown tungsten nanotendrils at low (50 eV) and high (12 keV) He bombardment energy, in the range 900–1000 °C, and characterized them using electron microscopy. Low energy tendrils are finer ({\textasciitilde}22 nm diameter) than high-energy tendrils ({\textasciitilde}176 nm diameter), and low-energy tendrils have a smoother surface than high-energy tendrils. Cavities were omnipresent and typically {\textasciitilde}5–10 nm in size. Oxygen was present at tendril surfaces, but tendrils were all BCC tungsten metal. Electron diffraction measured tendril growth axes and grain boundary angle/axis pairs; no preferential growth axes or angle/axis pairs were observed, and low-energy fuzz grain boundaries tended to be high angle; high energy tendril grain boundaries were not observed. We speculate that the strong tendency to high-angle grain boundaries in the low-energy tendrils implies that as the tendrils twist or bend, strain must accumulate until nucleation of a grain boundary is favorable compared to further lattice rotation. The high-energy tendrils consisted of very large ({\textgreater}100 nm) grains compared to the tendril size, so the nature of the high energy irradiation must enable faster growth with less lattice rotation.},

	abstract = {In this study, energetic helium (He) ion irradiation was performed to obtain bulk He distribution in tungsten (W) materials, concurrent with damage introduction at high temperature. Then, deuterium (D) implantation and thermal desorption spectrometry were performed to evaluate D retention. At the same time, the surface tritium (T) concentration and depth distribution were evaluated by imaging plate (IP) and β-ray induced X-ray spectroscopy (BIXS) measurements after mixed D-T gas exposure. Numerical simulations were applied to evaluate changes in binding energies, diffusion depths, and trapping sites under different irradiation conditions. The results showed that weak trapping sites with higher concentration, such as vacancies, were produced during only energetic He+ irradiation events, leading to enhancement of D retention. Fe3+-He+ simultaneous irradiation promoted the formation of HexVy complexes, which reduced the concentration of vacancy trapping sites and changed the stress field around defects, leading to the suppression of D trapping behavior. From the reduced effects of D retention caused by HexVy complexes at higher temperatures, the results suggested that defect recovery was the dominant mechanism. With increasing damage level at higher temperatures, more weak trapping sites, such as dislocations and vacancies sites, were produced, leading to a more dominant influence on D retention than HexVy complex effects. It was also found that HexVy complexes prevented D diffusion to the bulk and that simulation results showed that the damage level had little impact on D diffusion depth.},

	abstract = {On the eve of component procurement, this paper discusses the present physics basis for the first ITER tungsten (W) divertor, beginning with a reminder of the key elements defining the overall design, and outlining relevant aspects of the Research Plan accompanying the new “staged approach” to ITER nuclear operations which fixes the overall divertor lifetime constraint. The principal focus is on the main design driver, steady state power fluxes in the DT phases, obtained from simulations using the 2-D SOLPS-4.3 and SOLPS-ITER plasma boundary codes, assuming the use of the low Z seeding impurities nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne). A new perspective on the simulation database is adopted, concentrating purely on the divertor physics aspects rather than on the core-edge integration, which has been studied extensively in the course of the divertor design evolution and is published elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on factors which may increase the peak steady state loads: divertor target shaping for component misalignment protection, the influence of fluid drifts, and the consequences of narrow scrape-off layer heat flux channels. All tend to push the divertor into an operating space at higher sub-divertor neutral pressure in order to remain at power flux densities acceptable for the target material. However, a revised criterion for the maximum tolerable loads based on avoidance of W recrystallization, sets an upper limit potentially ∼50\% higher than the previously accepted value of ∼10 MW m−2, a consequence both of the choice of material and the finalized component design. Although the simulation database is currently restricted to the 2-D toroidally symmetric situation, considerable progress is now also being made using the EMC3-Eirene 3-D code suite for the assessment of power loading in the presence of magnetic perturbations for ELM control. Some new results for low input power corresponding to the early H-mode operation phases are reported, showing that even if realistic plasma screening is taken into account, significant asymmetric divertor heat fluxes may arise far from the unperturbed strike point. The issue of tolerable limits for transient heat pulses is an open and key question. A new scaling for ELM power deposition has shown that whilst there may be more latitude for operation at higher current without ELM control, the ultimate limit is likely to be set more by material fatigue under large numbers of sub-threshold melting events.},

The proton yield as a function of incident 3He energy was measured and the D depth profile was obtained by deconvolution of the measured proton yields using the program simnra. The depth at which deuterium is retained can be tentatively divided into three zones: (i) the near-surface layer (up to a depth of ∼0.2μm), (ii) the sub-surface layer (from ∼0.5 to ∼2μm), and (iii) the bulk ({\textgreater}5μm). Low-energy D ion irradiation modifies the W structure to depths of up to about 5μm, both for W single crystals and polycrystalline W. Up to this depth trapping sites are created at a fluence of 5×1022/m2 for the retention of deuterium at about 0.1at.\%.},

	abstract = {The change in surface damage/microstructures and its effects on the hydrogen (H) isotope/helium (He) dynamic behavior are the key factors for investigating issues of tungsten (W)-based plasma-facing materials (PFMs) in fusion such as surface erosion, H/He retention and tritium (T) inventory. Complex surface damage/microstructures are introduced in W by high-temperature plasma irradiation and new material design, typically including pre-damage and multi-ion co-deposition induced structures, solute elements and related composites, native defects like dislocations and interfaces, and nanostructures. Systematic experimental and theoretical researches were performed on H isotope/He retention in complex W-based materials in the past decades. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of typical surface damage/microstructures and their effects on H/He retention in W, both in the experiment and multiscale modeling. The distribution/state, dynamics evolution, and interaction with defects/microstructures of H/He are generally summarized at different scales. Finally, the current difficulties, challenges and future directions are also discussed about H/He retention in complex W-based PFMs.},

	abstract = {JET is used as a test bed for ITER, to investigate beryllium migration which connects the lifetime of first-wall components under erosion with tokamak safety, in relation to long-term fuel retention. The (i) limiter and the (ii) divertor configurations have been studied in JET-ILW (JET with a Be first wall and W divertor), and compared with those for the former JET-C (JET with carbon-based plasma-facing components (PFCs)). (i) For the limiter configuration, the Be gross erosion at the contact point was determined in situ by spectroscopy as between 4\% (Ein = 35 eV) and more than 100\%, caused by Be self-sputtering (Ein = 200 eV). Chemically assisted physical sputtering via BeD release has been identified to contribute to the effective Be sputtering yield, i.e. at Ein = 75 eV, erosion was enhanced by about 1/3 with respect to the bare physical sputtering case. An effective gross yield of 10\% is on average representative for limiter plasma conditions, whereas a factor of 2 difference between the gross erosion and net erosion, determined by post-mortem analysis, was found. The primary impurity source in the limiter configuration in JET-ILW is only 25\% higher (in weight) than that for the JET-C case. The main fraction of eroded Be stays within the main chamber. (ii) For the divertor configuration, neutral Be and BeD from physically and chemically assisted physical sputtering by charge exchange neutrals and residual ion flux at the recessed wall enter the plasma, ionize and are transported by scrape-off layer flows towards the inner divertor where significant net deposition takes place. The amount of Be eroded at the first wall (21 g) and the Be amount deposited in the inner divertor (28 g) are in fair agreement, though the balancing is as yet incomplete due to the limited analysis of PFCs. The primary impurity source in the JET-ILW is a factor of 5.3 less in comparison with that for JET-C, resulting in lower divertor material deposition, by more than one order of magnitude. Within the divertor, Be performs far fewer re-erosion and transport steps than C due to an energetic threshold for Be sputtering, and inhibits as a result of this the transport to the divertor floor and the pump duct entrance. The target plates in the JET-ILW inner divertor represent at the strike line a permanent net erosion zone, in contrast to the net deposition zone in JET-C with thick carbon deposits on the CFC (carbon-fibre composite) plates. The Be migration identified is consistent with the observed low long-term fuel retention and dust production with the JET-ILW.},

	abstract = {JET underwent a transformation from a full carbon-dominated tokamak to a fully metallic device with beryllium in the main chamber and a tungsten divertor. This material combination is foreseen for the activated phase of ITER. The ITER-Like Wall (ILW) experiment at JET shall demonstrate the plasma compatibility with metallic walls and the reduction in fuel retention. We report on a set of experiments (Ip = 2.0 MA, Bt = 2.0–2.4 T, δ = 0.2–0.4) in different confinement and plasma conditions with global gas balance analysis demonstrating a strong reduction in the long-term retention rate by more than a factor of 10 with respect to carbon-wall reference discharges. All experiments are executed in a series of identical plasma discharges in order to achieve maximum plasma duration until the analysis limit of the active gas handling system is reached. The composition analysis shows high purity of the recovered gas, typically 99\% D. For typical L-mode discharges (Paux = 0.5 MW), type III (Paux = 5.0 MW) and type-I ELMy H-mode plasmas (Paux = 12.0 MW) a drop of the deuterium retention rate normalized to the operational time in divertor configuration is measured from 1.27 × 1021, 1.37 × 1021 and 1.97 × 1021 D s−1 down to 4.8 × 1019, 7.2 × 1019 and 16 × 1019 D s−1, respectively. The dynamic retention increases in the limiter phase in comparison with carbon-fibre composite, but also the outgassing after the discharge has risen in the same manner and overcompensates this transient retention. Overall an upper limit of the long-term retention rate of 1.5 × 1020 D s−1 is obtained with the ILW. The observed reduction by one order of magnitude confirms the expected predictions concerning the plasma-facing material change in ITER and is in line with identification of fuel co-deposition with Be as the main mechanism for the residual long-term retention. The reduction widens the operational space without active cleaning in the DT phase in comparison with a full carbon device.},

	abstract = {Effects of surface processes on hydrogen outgassing during desorption experiments are investigated using a standard reaction–diffusion model describing hydrogen transport, retention and desorption in material. Three mechanisms for hydrogen migration and desorption on material surface are considered: hydrogen migration from material bulk to material surface (readsorption), hydrogen migration from material surface to material bulk (reabsorption) and hydrogen desorption from material surface by molecular recombination. Three hydrogen outgassing regimes are identified: (i) recombination-limited outgassing when hydrogen recombination and desorption is fast compared to hydrogen reabsorption and slow compared to hydrogen transport from material bulk onto material surface (ii) reabsorption-limited outgassing when hydrogen recombination and desorption is slow compared to hydrogen reabsorption and when the effective hydrogen recombination and desorption is slow compared to hydrogen transport from material bulk onto material surface (iii) bulk-limited outgassing otherwise. Regimes of hydrogen outgassing from tungsten and beryllium are estimated for various experimental conditions. Analytical expressions of the outgassing flux are then derived for each outgassing regime, and used to characterize TDS spectra obtained in thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments. It is shown that TDS spectra in recombination-limited regime are skewed toward high temperature, while TDS spectra in reabsorption-limited and bulk-limited regimes are skewed toward low temperature. Furthermore, the temperature of the desorption peak in TDS spectra is shown to decrease in recombination-limited regime and to increase in reabsorption-limited and bulk-limited regimes as the total amount of hydrogen stored in material increases. Finally, it is observed that the effective hydrogen recombination rate measured in reabsorption-limited permeation experiments may be not be reliably used to model and predict hydrogen retention and recycling from tungsten during plasma operations in tokamak.},

After the exposure the samples were also analysed by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy. A clear difference in the time dependence of deuterium uptake was noticed between different samples. The experimental results were modeled using a rate-equation model. The influence of different grain size was modeled by changing the effective height of the potential barrier for deuterium atoms to enter into the bulk.

	abstract = {Beryllium (Be) has been chosen as the plasma-facing material for the main wall of ITER, the next generation fusion reactor. Identifying the key parameters that determine Be erosion under reactor relevant conditions is vital to predict the ITER plasma-facing component lifetime and viability. To date, a certain prediction of Be erosion, focusing on the effect of two such parameters, surface temperature and D surface content, has not been achieved. In this work, we develop the first multi-scale KMC-MD modeling approach for Be to provide a more accurate database for its erosion, as well as investigating parameters that affect erosion. First, we calculate the complex relationship between surface temperature and D concentration precisely by simulating the time evolution of the system using an object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) technique. These simulations provide a D surface concentration profile for any surface temperature and incoming D energy. We then describe how this profile can be implemented as a starting configuration in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We finally use MD simulations to investigate the effect of temperature (300–800 K) and impact energy (10–200 eV) on the erosion of Be due to D plasma irradiations. The results reveal a strong dependency of the D surface content on temperature. Increasing the surface temperature leads to a lower D concentration at the surface, because of the tendency of D atoms to avoid being accommodated in a vacancy, and de-trapping from impurity sites diffuse fast toward bulk. At the next step, total and molecular Be erosion yields due to D irradiations are analyzed using MD simulations. The results show a strong dependency of erosion yields on surface temperature and incoming ion energy. The total Be erosion yield increases with temperature for impact energies up to 100 eV. However, increasing temperature and impact energy results in a lower fraction of Be atoms being sputtered as BeD molecules due to the lower D surface concentrations at higher temperatures. These findings correlate well with different experiments performed at JET and PISCES-B devices.},

	abstract = {Fusion fuel retention (trapping) and release (desorption) from plasma-facing components are critical issues for ITER and for any future industrial demonstration reactors such as DEMO. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind the retention of hydrogen isotopes in first wall and divertor materials is necessary. We developed an approach that couples dedicated experimental studies with modelling at all relevant scales, from microscopic elementary steps to macroscopic observables, in order to build a reliable and predictive fusion reactor wall model. This integrated approach is applied to the ITER divertor material (tungsten), and advances in the development of the wall model are presented. An experimental dataset, including focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, isothermal desorption, temperature programmed desorption, nuclear reaction analysis and Auger electron spectroscopy, is exploited to initialize a macroscopic rate equation wall model. This model includes all elementary steps of modelled experiments: implantation of fusion fuel, fuel diffusion in the bulk or towards the surface, fuel trapping on defects and release of trapped fuel during a thermal excursion of materials. We were able to show that a single-trap-type single-detrapping-energy model is not able to reproduce an extended parameter space study of a polycrystalline sample exhibiting a single desorption peak. It is therefore justified to use density functional theory to guide the initialization of a more complex model. This new model still contains a single type of trap, but includes the density functional theory findings that the detrapping energy varies as a function of the number of hydrogen isotopes bound to the trap. A better agreement of the model with experimental results is obtained when grain boundary defects are included, as is consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the studied sample. Refinement of this grain boundary model is discussed as well as the inclusion in the model of a thin defective oxide layer following the experimental observation of the presence of an oxygen layer on the surface even after annealing to 1300 K.},

	abstract = {The recycling of D ions impinging onto a W divertor surface is a key input parameter into the power and momentum balance at the target boundary during SOL modeling. It is described by the ratio R of the flux of recombining D2 molecules to the non-reflected incident ion flux. In steady-state plasmas where the surface is in equilibrium with the incident flux, R equals one due to particle conservation. However, during transient events such as edge localized modes (ELMs) the evolution of R with time is not straightforward to predict. Therefore, detailed diffusion-trapping calculations were performed taking into account the variations in power influx and particle energy during an ELM. They showed that in contrast to the naive expectation, that the ELM would deplete the surface and subsequently lead to ‘pumping’ (R 1) of the incident flux by the empty surface, R ≈ 1 or even R occurs. This paper will first describe how the ELM was approximated in the 1D diffusion-trapping code and then discuss the evolution of R during an ELM and in the inter ELM phase. Also, an analytical picture of R will be developed which allows qualitatively understanding the evolution of R as calculated by the diffusion-trapping code.},

Retention as a function of ion fluence was measured in the 1017–1021 D+·m−2 range. By combining this new fluence range with the literature in situ experimental data, we evidence the existence of a retention ∝ fluence0.645±0.025 relationship which describes deuterium retention behavior on polycrystalline tungsten on 8 orders of magnitude of fluence. Evolution of deuterium retention as a function of the sample storage time in vacuum at room temperature was followed. A loss of 50\% of the retained deuterium is observed when the storage time is increased from 2 h to 135 h. The role of the surface and of natural bulk defects on the deuterium retention/release in polycrystalline tungsten is discussed in light of the behavior of the single desorption peak obtained with Temperature Programmed Desorption.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information.

	abstract = {We present a new framework to quantify the effect of hydrogen on dislocations using large scale three-dimensional (3D) discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. In this model, the first order elastic interaction energy associated with the hydrogen-induced volume change is accounted for. The three-dimensional stress tensor induced by hydrogen concentration, which is in equilibrium with respect to the dislocation stress field, is derived using the Eshelby inclusion model, while the hydrogen bulk diffusion is treated as a continuum process. This newly developed framework is utilized to quantify the effect of different hydrogen concentrations on the dynamics of a glide dislocation in the absence of an applied stress field as well as on the spacing between dislocations in an array of parallel edge dislocations. A shielding effect is observed for materials having a large hydrogen diffusion coefficient, with the shield effect leading to the homogenization of the shrinkage process leading to the glide loop maintaining its circular shape, as well as resulting in a decrease in dislocation separation distances in the array of parallel edge dislocations. On the other hand, for materials having a small hydrogen diffusion coefficient, the high hydrogen concentrations around the edge characters of the dislocations act to pin them. Higher stresses are required to be able to unpin the dislocations from the hydrogen clouds surrounding them. Finally, this new framework can open the door for further large scale studies on the effect of hydrogen on the different aspects of dislocation-mediated plasticity in metals. With minor modifications of the current formulations, the framework can also be extended to account for general inclusion-induced stress field in discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {The impact of helium (He) plasma exposure with He fluxes relevant for ITER and WEST on the near-surface microstructure of polycrystalline tungsten (W) is investigated by coupling transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) measurements. The samples were exposed in the PSI-2 linear plasma device to 75 eV He ions up to the fluence of 3 × 1023 He m−2 with the surface temperature in the range 1053–1073 K. The obtained He bubbles–enriched W samples are subsequently probed with sequences of low flux and low fluence 250 eV deuterium (D) ion implantations and TDS measurements in an ultra-high-vacuum setup to study the effects of the near-surface morphology changes due to the helium irradiation on fundamental mechanisms of deuterium retention. The results obtained for two different near-surface layer He bubbles morphologies revealed that the effects of He irradiation on D retention in W strongly depend on its subsequent thermal cycling. For annealing below 900 K, deuterium retention is similar to the one measured in pristine W. In contrast, for annealing above 1150 K, deuterium retention in the He bubbles-enriched W is increased 3–8 fold as compared to non-damaged W. Additionally, the deuterium desorption peak shifts from 540 to 450 K. This increase of D trapping in the He bubbles-enriched W annealed above 1150 K is presumably associated with a modification of the near-surface microstructure concurrent with an outgassing of He.},

	abstract = {The first wall of a future magnetic fusion device is essentially defined as the plasma-facing surface of the breeding blankets, which is supposed to be subjected to bi-directional hydrogen isotopes permeation: in one direction by edge plasma-driven permeation (PDP) of deuterium as well as tritium into blankets, and in the other direction by breed tritium gas-driven permeation (GDP) into the edge plasma. Deuterium and tritium PDP will complicate the recovery of tritium from the blanket, while tritium GDP will lead to an unwanted increase of particle recycling in the first wall region, which could even affect core confinement performance. Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels are widely proposed as candidate structural materials for the blanket of a DEMO reactor, the surface coatings made of tungsten are necessary to protect the plasma-facing wall from sputtering under high-energy particle bombardment. Therefore, the characterization of hydrogen isotopes transport through a multi-layer W + RAFM wall is of crucial importance to evaluate major reactor design issues including tritium retention, particle recycling and breeding feasibility, etc. This paper is intended to provide a review over the transport parameters of hydrogen isotopes in RAFM steels, including permeability, diffusivity, solubility and surface recombination coefficient. In addition, the present research status of hydrogen isotopes permeation and retention behavior of tungsten coated RAFM steels is briefly introduced.},

	abstract = {The divertor is the key in-vessel plasma-facing component being in charge of power exhaust and removal of impurity particles. In DEMO, divertor targets must survive an environment of high heat fluxes (∼up to 20 MW m−2 during slow transients) and neutron irradiation. One advanced concept for components in monoblock configuration concerns the insertion of a compositionally graded layer between tungsten and CuCrZr instead of the soft copper interlayer. As a first step, a thin graded layer (∼25 μm) was developed. As a second step, a thicker graded layer (∼500 μm), which is actually being developed, will also be inserted to study the compliant role of a macroscopic graded layer. This paper reports the results of cyclic high heat flux loading tests up to 20 MW m−2 and to heat flux higher than 25 MW m−2 that mock-ups equipped with thin graded layer survived without visible damage. First feedback on manufacturing steps is also presented. Moreover, the first results obtained on the development of the thick graded layer and its integration in a monoblock configuration are shown.},

It affects the particle-, momentum- and energy balance in the scrape off layer as well as the retention of HIs and their permeation into the coolant. The currently accepted picture that is used for interpreting current laboratory and tokamak experiments is that of diffusion hindered by trapping at lattice defects. This paper summarises recent results that show that this current picture of how HIs are transported and retained in W needs to be extended: the modification of the surface (e.g. blistering) can lead to the formation of fast loss channels for near surface HIs. Trapping at single occupancy traps with fixed de-trapping energy fails to explain isotope exchange experiments, instead a trapping model with multi occupancy traps and fill level dependent de-trapping energies is required. The presence of interstitial impurities like N or C may affect the transport of solute HI. The presence of HIs during damage creation by e.g. neutrons stabilises defects and reduces defect annealing at elevated temperatures.},

	abstract = {This textbook is designed for a one year course covering the fundamentals of partial differential equations, geared towards advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in mathematics, science, engineering, and elsewhere. The exposition carefully balances solution techniques, mathematical rigor, and significant applications, all illustrated by numerous examples. Extensive exercise sets appear at the end of almost every subsection, and include straightforward computational problems to develop and reinforce new techniques and results, details on theoretical developments and proofs, challenging projects both computational and conceptual, and supplementary material that motivates the student to delve further into the subject.No previous experience with the subject of partial differential equations or Fourier theory is assumed, the main prerequisites being undergraduate calculus, both one- and multi-variable, ordinary differential equations, and basic linear algebra. While the classical topics of separation of variables, Fourier analysis, boundary value problems, Green's functions, and special functions continue to form the core of an introductory course, the inclusion of nonlinear equations, shock wave dynamics, symmetry and similarity, the Maximum Principle, financial models, dispersion and solitons, Huygens'. Principle, quantum mechanical systems, and more make this text well attuned to recent developments and trends in this active field of contemporary research. Numerical approximation schemes are an important component of any introductory course, and the text covers the two most basic approaches: finite differences and finite elements.Furthermore, a Solution Manual for instrucors is available by clicking on "Selected Solutions Manual" under the Additional Information section on the right-hand side of this page. Peter J. Olver is professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota. His wide-ranging research interests are centered on the development of symmetry-based methods for differential equations and their manifold applications. He is the author of over 130 papers published in major scientific research journals as well as 4 other books, including the definitive Springer graduate text, Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations, and another undergraduate text, Applied Linear Algebra.},

Nos résultats montrent que l'hydrogène diffuse par un mécanisme à stade unique de 285 K jusqu'à la température de fusion; l'on n'observe pas d'écart par rapport à un comportement d'Arrhenius, écart qui serait dû à des effets de piègeage mettant en jeu des lacunes.
Zusammenfassung
Mit einer elektrolytischen Methode wurde die Diffusivität von Wasserstoff in Aluminium im Temperaturbereich zwischen 285 und 328 K in einem viskosen Elektrolyten gemessen. Aus den Ergebnissen folgt, daβ H über einen einstufigen Prozeβ zwischen 285 K und der Schmelztemperatur diffundiert. Abweichungen vom Arrhenius-Verhalten durch Einfangeffekte an Gitterleerstellen werden nicht beobachtet.},

This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},

	abstract = {The European DEMO fusion power reactor (EU-DEMO) is still in the pre-conceptual design phase. The design strategy for the EU-DEMO hinges on investigating multiple reactor designs and technologies in parallel, progressively down-selecting these in the mid-2020s, in preparation for the conceptual design phase. The present implementation of the strategy centres around a baseline single-null design, which is configuration controlled and iterated approximately every two years. The majority of resources are dedicated to studying the baseline design; changing it is expensive, and takes months to do. Competing technologies for different sub-systems (e.g. blankets, magnets) are forced to co-exist within the same physical confines (CAD models), and conform to the same set of performance criteria. Meanwhile, the alternative reactor designs are only loosely defined, with no agreed set of parameters, no CAD models, and no formal framework for study. We argue that the EU-DEMO design strategy is best served by a more efficient implementation methodology which would enable more comprehensive exploration of the DEMO design space. We make the case for a change in approach to the design of DEMO-class reactors in Europe, and propose a solution which bears some resemblance to the present methodology, yet automates and accelerates the sequence of design and analysis activities when generating a design configuration. We present our preliminary attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, in the form of a new fusion reactor design code: BLUEPRINT. We demonstrate that the typical activities required to generate a DEMO design point can be sped up by four orders of magnitude—from months to minutes—paving the way for a rigorous and broad exploration of the design space.},

	abstract = {Interactions between the plasma and the vessel walls constitute a major engineering problem for next step fusion devices, such as ITER, determining the choice of the plasma-facing materials. A prominent issue in this choice is the tritium inventory build-up in the vessel, which must be limited for safety reasons. The initial material selection, i.e. beryllium (Be) on the main vessel walls, tungsten (W) on the divertor upper baffle and dome, and carbon fibre composite around the strike points on the divertor plates, results both from the attempt to reduce the tritium inventory and to optimize the lifetime of the plasma-facing components.In the framework of the EU Task Force on Plasma–Wall Interaction (PWI TF), the many physics aspects governing the tritium inventory are brought together. Together with supporting information from international experts represented by the ITPA SOL/DIV section, this paper describes the present status of knowledge of the in-vessel tritium inventory build-up. Firstly, the main results from present fusion devices in this field are briefly reviewed. Then, the processes involved are discussed: implantation, trapping and diffusion in plasma-facing materials are considered as well as surface erosion and co-deposition of tritium with eroded material. The intermixing of the different materials and its influence on hydrogen retention and co-deposition is a major source of uncertainty on present estimates and is also addressed.Based on the previous considerations, estimates for the tritium inventory build-up are given for the initial choice of ITER materials, as well as for alternative options. Present estimates indicate a build-up of the tritium inventory to the administrative limit within a few hundred nominal full power D : T discharges, co-deposition with carbon being the dominant process. Therefore, tritium removal methods are also an active area of research within the EU PWI TF, and are discussed. An integrated operational scheme to slow the rate of tritium accumulation is presented, which includes plasma operation as well as conditioning procedures.},

Not systematically but frequently macro-cracks appeared at the middle of monoblocks after 20MW/m2 loading. The initiation of such macro-cracks was considered to be due to cyclic exposure to high temperature, ∼2000°C, where creep, recrystallization and low cycle fatigue were concerned. To understand correlation between the macro-crack appearance and mechanical properties and possible update of acceptance criteria in the material specification, an activity to characterize the tungsten monoblocks was launched.},

The new facility allows for implanting a range of gases into samples, including tritium. An accurate study of isotope effects, such as the isotopic exchange in damaged microstructure, has previously been difficult due to a background signal of light hydrogen. This new capability will allow virtually background free measurements using tritium and deuterium. The design and build of this facility are described and commissioning results are presented. Within the UKAEA-led tritium retention in controlled and evolving microstructure (TRiCEM) project, this facility is used for the comparative study of deuterium retention in self-ion irradiated Eurofer steel and Fe–Cr alloy. Self-ion bombardment with energies of 0.5 MeV is used to mimic the defects created by neutrons in fusion power plants and the created traps are then filled with deuterium in the new facility. Implanted samples are analysed using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and transmission electron microscopy. Results on the total deuterium content as a function of time, TDS spectra and SIMS analysis are presented. A comparison of the results for Eurofer and Fe–Cr revealed several differences. While some of them may be due to experimental details like different time delays between exposure and analysis, others, such as deuterium retention as function of dose, might be genuine and require further studies.},

It is shown that the recombination coefficient of H on a clean W surface is extremely high which indicates the rapid desorption of the hydrogen molecule from the surface.

	abstract = {The thermal desorption technique can be used in principle to determine the trapping characteristics of different microstructural trap sites in metals provided there are adequate models to fit to the experimental data. A brief review of models of thermal desorption is presented which indicates that there are limitations in the assumptions made or in the scope of existing models. A more rigorous mathematical model has now been developed which accounts for diffusion, detrapping, and retrapping at one or more type of trap site and which allows for varying trap occupancy. The effect of material and experimental variables on the thermal desorption spectrum has been evaluated and the validity of simple models of desorption assessed. The simpler analytical models, such as the detrapping model of Lee and Lee, in which diffusion is neglected relative to detrapping, do not inspire confidence and are applicable only under very limiting circumstances; for example, in low alloy steels at very low hydrogen contents. It is recommended that thermal desorption measurements be made at progressively decreasing values of initial hydrogen content until the simple analysis yields a consistent value for the trapping parameters. This experimental approach is applicable also to models of thermal desorption which account for diffusion using an effective diffusivity, since trap occupancy is neglected in these. The more rigorous model described herein can be used to determine the binding energy of the traps directly which, together with the density of trap sites, is the most important parameter with respect to hydrogen assisted cracking. The height of the energy barrier to trapping, at constant value of the binding energy, is shown to have only a modest effect on the thermal desorption spectrum compared with the impact of binding energy and of density of trap sites.},

	abstract = {An extension of the SolEdge2D-EIRENE code package, named D-WEE, has been developed to add the dynamics of thermal desorption of hydrogen isotopes from the surface of plasma facing materials. To achieve this purpose, D-WEE models hydrogen isotopes implantation, transport and retention in those materials. Before launching auto-consistent simulation (with feedback of D-WEE on SolEdge2D-EIRENE), D-WEE has to be initialised to ensure a realistic wall behaviour in terms of dynamics (pumping or fuelling areas) and fuel content. A methodology based on modelling is introduced to perform such initialisation. A synthetic plasma pulse is built from consecutive SolEdge2D-EIRENE simulations. This synthetic pulse is used as a plasma background for the D-WEE module. A sequence of plasma pulses is simulated with D-WEE to model a tokamak operation. This simulation enables to extract at a desired time during a pulse the local fuel inventory and the local desorption flux density which could be used as initial condition for coupled plasma-wall simulations. To assess the relevance of the dynamic retention behaviour obtained in the simulation, a confrontation to post-pulse experimental pressure measurement is performed. Such confrontation reveals a qualitative agreement between the temporal pressure drop obtained in the simulation and the one observed experimentally. The simulated dynamic retention during the consecutive pulses is also studied.},

In this study, He irradiations in the NAGDIS-II linear plasma device, at temperatures below recrystallization and low energies (50 eV) followed by annealing at 1470 K were carried out. Additionally, high energy (28 keV) hydrogen (H) with an admixture of 6 at\% He irradiations in the neutral beam facility GLADIS were performed at temperatures above recrystallization (1770 K). These are compared to pure H irradiations under the same conditions. In the low temperature cases, following irradiation, an undulating microstructure is observed on the surface of the samples after irradiation. After annealing at 1470 K, it is observed that the inhibition effect of He irradiation is more pronounced following lower temperature exposures. The effect of He irradiation on inhibition of recrystallization with grain growth is also observed to saturate at the highest fluences. In the high temperature, high energy case, He irradiation and recrystallization happens simultaneously. Following the irradiation a coral like microstructure is observed on the surface of the sample. The introduction of He is not seen to have a significant effect on the recrystallization process of W when the irradiation is carried out at temperatures above recrystallization.},

The simulation results agree well with observed results of low energy He implanted tungsten experiments, and thus provide an explanation for the observed surface morphology changes caused by low energy He implantation of tungsten.},

	abstract = {The influence of helium and argon impurities on the deuterium retention in tungsten is investigated by a numerical diffusion model, which treats diffusing depth profiles for deuterium and helium or argon in tungsten, taking into account the suggested effects of helium or argon. With helium, a helium nanobubble layer builds up at the surface of the sample, with depths higher than the penetration depth of the incident helium and deuterium ions. The nanobubbles form a porous network, which allows the release of trapped deuterium by surface recombination and diffusion through the pores to the surface. For argon, only a shallow layer of argon-induced defects exists, which also act as trapping sites for deuterium. A number of experiments with tungsten samples were conducted at the linear plasma device PSI-2 in support of the model. Helium and argon were admixed to deuterium plasma in ratios of up to 8\% for otherwise similar exposure conditions. In addition, a variation of ion fluences was performed for investigation of the onset and evolution of the effects of impurities. The model shows that the influence on the deuterium retention both for helium nanobubbles as well as for argon-induced defects depends strongly on the ratio between the thickness of the helium- or argon-affected layer and the penetration depth of deuterium ions.},

In earlier works, only first-order transition states (1TS) were used to compute the diffusivity at the atomic-scale: the direct diffusion between tetrahedral (t) and octahedral (o) sites has been proposed to describe atomic-scale diffusion mechanisms. However, we show here that if this direct diffusion makes it possible to reproduce displacements remarkably well, neglecting higher-order transition states induces an underestimation of the diffusion coefficient at high temperature. We hereinafter revisit the diffusion coefficient of interstitial species in different fcc-systems. The effect of these configurations on atom diffusion in Al, Co, Cu, Ni and Pd, whose only stable sites are the tetrahedral and octahedral positions (H and O atoms) is thus discussed here. We show that if the correction is low, taking into account higher-transition states can modify the diffusivity values at high temperature.},

The sum of the D binding energy (Eb) with vacancies and the activation energy for D diffusion (ED) in W was then directly determined from the slope of the Arrhenius-like plot ln(β/Tm2) versus 1/Tm, where β – heating rate and Tm – position of the respective peak in the TDS spectrum.

Good agreement is found when comparing the experimental TDS curves with the desorption flux based on a numerical diffusion model using a homogeneous average hydrogen diffusion coefficient for the two-phase (ferrite-austenite) duplex microstructure. Trapping cannot be distinguished from the experimental TDS data since hydrogen diffusion in austenite is the rate-determining process during desorption. An average diffusion activation energy of 43.4 kJ/mol is determined from the experiments. Moreover, similar findings are obtained with a finite-element model that includes the heterogeneous hydrogen-related properties of the two phases of this duplex stainless steel.},

	abstract = {In a fusion tokamak, the plasma of hydrogen isotopes is in contact with tungsten at the surface of a divertor. In the bulk of the material, the hydrogen concentration profile tends towards dynamic equilibrium between the flux of incident ions and their trapping and release from defects, either native or produced by ion and neutron irradiation. The dynamics of hydrogen exchange between the plasma and the material is controlled by pressure, temperature, and also by the energy barriers characterizing hydrogen diffusion in the material, trapping and de-trapping from defects. In this work, we extend the treatment of interaction of hydrogen with vacancy-type defects, and investigate how hydrogen is trapped by self-interstitial atom defects and dislocations. The accumulation of hydrogen on dislocation loops and dislocations is assessed using a combination of density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics with empirical potentials, and linear elasticity theory. The equilibrium configurations adopted by hydrogen atoms in the core of dislocations as well as in the elastic fields of defects, are modelled by DFT. The structure of the resulting configurations can be rationalised assuming that hydrogen atoms interact elastically with lattice distortions and that they interact between themselves through short-range repulsion. We formulate a two-shell model for hydrogen interaction with an interstitial defect of any size, which predicts how hydrogen accumulates at defects, dislocation loops and line dislocations at a finite temperature. We derive analytical formulae for the number of hydrogen atoms forming the Cottrell atmosphere of a mesoscopic dislocation loop or an edge dislocation. The solubility of hydrogen as a function of temperature, pressure and the density of dislocations exhibits three physically distinct regimes, dominated by the solubility of hydrogen in a perfect lattice, its retention at dislocation cores, and trapping by long-range elastic fields of dislocations.},

Hydrogen isotopes penetrate and diffuse into the material and interact with defects where they are trapped. Neutrons produced by the fusion reactions in the plasma are stopped in the material, creating defects, including vacancy and interstitial clusters, and dislocation loops. The trapping of hydrogen in vacancies has been extensively investigated. In our recent paper (De Backer et al 2017 Nucl. Fusion), we proposed a multi-scale model for H trapping and accumulation around interstitial defects, dislocation loops and dislocation lines. These defects create a long-range elastic field that attracts and may retain H atoms. A two-shell model with a short-range core region and a long-range elastic shell has been parameterized using a database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This model gives the number of H atoms forming the Cottrell atmosphere of a defect at finite temperature. In this paper, we present new DFT calculations of large dislocation loops decorated with up to 80 H, and explore our two-shell model in fusion relevant conditions. We conclude that large dislocation loops and edge dislocations can trap a significant number of hydrogen atoms in the core at temperatures up to 800 K, and also in the elastic field if the background hydrogen concentration is high.},

As a remedy we propose a new step, which we call an oriented restart, that reinitializes the simplex to a smaller one with orthogonal edges whose orientation is determined by an approximate descent direction from the current best point. We also give results that apply when the objective function is a low-amplitude perturbation of a smooth function. We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.},

A clear tendency for hydrogen to segregate to the bubble-matrix interface is observed in these simulations, regardless of the initial spatial distribution of the hydrogen or simulation parameters. This segregation is due in part to a local minimum in the hydrogen energy at the periphery of the bubble. Further work is required to fully characterize the mechanism of this behavior and to assess the quantities of hydrogen in the bubble and at the bubble periphery.},

Thermal helium desorption spectrometry (THDS), through measuring the outward He surface flux as a function of temperature (or time), provides indirect information about the kinetics and energetics of helium transport and trapping/detrapping which is important for developing a predictive assessment for the life performance of fusion reactors. Nevertheless, THDS data interpretation is not straightforward, particularly when a broad temperature regime and a high He concentration are concerned. Here we present results from a spatially-dependent rate theory modeling framework in coordination with our previous THDS experiments on single crystal iron implanted with 4He+ ions at 5 or 10keV to fluences of 1018 or 1019 He/m2. The model incorporates both temporally and spatially dependent diffusion, trapping, and detrapping (emission) kinetics for both implantation process and post-implantation thermal annealing.

Using the brute ab initio data yields a significant discrepancy with experimental measurements. On the other hand, good agreement is obtained when the vacancy migration energy is increased from the original ab initio value while the binding energies of vacancies with substitutional and interstitial helium are lowered. The presence of impurities, with carbon being the most likely candidate, is proposed as a justification for these effective energies.

	abstract = {We report a hierarchical multi-scale modeling study of implanted helium segregation on surfaces of tungsten, considered as a plasma facing component in nuclear fusion reactors. We employ a hierarchy of atomic-scale simulations based on a reliable interatomic interaction potential, including molecular-statics simulations to understand the origin of helium surface segregation, targeted molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of near-surface cluster reactions, and large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten. We find that small, mobile He n (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in the near-surface region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. This elastic interaction force induces drift fluxes of these mobile He n clusters, which increase substantially as the migrating clusters approach the surface, facilitating helium segregation on the surface. Moreover, the clusters’ drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions, most importantly trap mutation, in the near-surface region at rates much higher than in the bulk material. These near-surface cluster dynamics have significant effects on the surface morphology, near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure. We integrate the findings of such atomic-scale simulations into a properly parameterized and validated spatially dependent, continuum-scale reaction-diffusion cluster dynamics model, capable of predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. This cluster-dynamics model sets the stage for development of fully atomistically informed coarse-grained models for computationally efficient simulation predictions of helium surface segregation, as well as helium retention and surface morphological evolution, toward optimal design of plasma facing components.},

Transmission electron microscope observation showed that implantation of hydrogen into the specimens pre-irradiated by helium can result in obvious enhancement of bubble size and swelling rate which can be regarded as a consequence of hydrogen being trapped by helium bubbles. But when temperature increased, Ostwald ripening mechanism would become dominant, besides, too large a bubble could become mobile and swallow many tiny bubbles on their way moving, reducing bubble number density. And these effects were most remarkable at 450°C which was the peak bubble swelling temperature for RAMF steel. When temperature was high enough, say above 450, point defects would become mobile and annihilate at dislocations or surface. As a consequence, helium could no longer effectively diffuse and clustering in materials and bubble formation was suppressed. When temperature was above 500, helium bubbles would become unstable and decompose or migrate out of surface. Finally no bubble was observed at 650°C.},

In this system, fuzzy tungsten was grown over a range of helium ion fluences, , sample temperatures and helium ion energies, but with operator control over the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio at the sample (from 0.003 to 0.009). In the presence of tungsten deposition, it appears that the fuzz growth has two distinct stages: at low to intermediate helium ion fluence the fuzzy layer thickness follows the expected diffusive law augmented by approximately the ‘effective’ thin film thickness of deposited tungsten; at high fluences the fuzz thickness increases very steeply with . These observations are explained through the increase in the porosity of the fuzzy layer as it reaches thicknesses larger than ∼1 m. It was observed that during the second phase of fuzz growth the thickness was highly dependent on both the sample temperature and the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio. For the same helium ion exposure, an increase in the sample temperature from 1050 to 1150 K lead to a six-fold increase in the fuzzy layer thickness, whilst increasing the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio over the full range produced a two-fold increase in the thickness.

	abstract = {The effects of helium (He)-vacancy clusters on the stress-strain behavior of polycrystalline iron (α-Fe) are investigated by a mechanistic finite element (FE) approach using a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) description of the material behavior informed by molecular dynamics (MD) data. First, MD analyses of a single crystal (loading normal to \{332\} plane) and a bicrystal system containing a Σ11{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{332\} grain boundary (GB) were performed to compute the uniaxial tensile response of an Fe single crystal and a system with a GB. MD results were then used in FE analyses of the same systems to identify parameters for the CDM constitutive relations for the crystal and the traction-separation law for the GB depicted by cohesive elements. Next, a 3D FE model of an α-Fe bicrystal system with an imperfect GB subjected to uniaxial tensile loading was developed. This model includes an equivalent hollow sphere under internal pressure in the middle of the GB to model the effects of pressurized He bubbles at 5 K, room temperature (RT) and 600 K on stress, strain and damage distributions. The radius of the equivalent sphere was determined assuming the presence of two vacancies in the system. Finally, MD stress/strain data of the same bicrystal system with He-vacancy clusters were compared to the corresponding FE results to validate this mechanistic approach that appears to be efficient in terms of computational time. FE model predictions of system strength and fracture strain are in fairly good agreement with the MD results at all three temperatures. Our results show that small and highly pressurized He-vacancy clusters reduce GB strength and fracture strain more significantly at 5 K than at RT and 600 K.},

In this perspective the fate of helium in tungsten was studied by mean of several characterization techniques. The aim of this study is to highlight the trapping mechanisms of helium in tungsten and their correlation with implantation-induced defects. Helium was implanted into tungsten at two different energies, 0.32 and 60keV. The helium was studied as a function of temperature by using nuclear reaction analysis. The migration propensity of helium was correlated with the release rate of helium after annealing at a given temperature. In addition, the helium trapping sites and evolution with post-implantation annealing was investigated using Doppler-Broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy. It has been shown that the release, and so the migration, of helium is guided by the concentration of implantation-induced defects and the nature of the helium traps created during the implantation.},

The desorption of this retained hydrogen was seen to follow a t α law with α ≈ −0.7 in tokamaks. For a pulsed fusion reactor this outgassing can define the inter-pulse waiting time. This work presents new experimental data on the dynamic outgassing in ITER grade tungsten exposed under the well-defined conditions of PSI-2 to pure and mixed D2 plasmas. A peak ion flux of 1022 D+ m−2 s is applied for up to 6 h at sample temperatures of up to 900 K. Pure D2 and mixed D2 + He, D2 + N2 and D2 + He + N2 plasmas are applied to the sample at 68 V bias. The D2, He, N outgassing at 293 K and 580 k are observed via in-vacuo quadrupole mass spectrometry covering the range of 40 s–200 000 s after exposure. The outgassing decay follows a single power law with exponents α = −0.7 to −1.1 at 293 K, but at 580 K a drop from α = −0.25 to −2.35 is found. For DEMO a pump-down time to 0.5 mPa in the order of 1–5 h can be expected. The outgassing is in all cases dominated by D2.},

This model is implemented in a three-dimensional framework and used to predict the relationship between helium bubble formation and the nano-composite microstructure, including interfacial free volume, grain size, and layer thickness. Interstitial and vacancy-like migration of helium is considered. The effects of changing layer thickness and interfacial misfit dislocation density on the threshold for helium bubble nucleation are found to match experiments.

	title = {Numerical {Simulations} of {Tungsten} under {Helium} {Irradiation}},
	abstract = {Magnetic confinement fusion is a promising technology for electricity production due to available fuel and low waste products. However, the construction of a nuclear fusion reactor remains
a scientific challenge. One of the main issues is the resistance of the plasma facing materials exposed to very harsh operating conditions. Tungsten is the leading candidate for the divertor, a
crucial plasma facing component. This dissertation focuses on modeling the behavior of tungsten under irradiation conditions relevant to the divertor operations using a multi-scale modeling
approach. In particular, high fluxes of helium ions at low energy impact the divertor and are responsible for changes in the tungsten microstructure such as the formation of helium blisters and
”fuzz”-like structures which can ultimately lead to erosion, degradation of materials performance
and materials failure.
A spatially dependent cluster dynamics model is introduced in order to model the evolution of
the tungsten microstructure under irradiation. This continuum model is based on kinetic rate theory and handles each material defect type independently. Under the assumptions of a low dilute
limit and no spatial correlation between defects, this leads to a large system of non-linear reactiondiffusion equations. Hence, the results addressed in this thesis consist in the determination of the
kinetic parameters for the cluster dynamics model, the construction of a solver which efficiently
deals with the large non-linear system of partial differential equations, the determination of the
applicability of the model to fusion relevant conditions, and the model results for a variety of irradiation conditions.
The input kinetic parameters to the cluster dynamics model are the defects’ diffusion coefficients, binding energies and capture radii. These can be determined using a molecular dynamics and
density functional theory simulations as well as empirical data. The challenge lies in obtaining a
consistent set of kinetic parameters. Therefore, a method to determine the value of the diffusion
coefficients for small helium, interstitial and vacancy defects at various temperatures using only
molecular dynamics simulations is presented. Binding energies are also determined using molecular dynamics, and when combined with the diffusion coefficients they form a consistent set of
kinetic parameters.
An efficient implementation of a parallel solver is presented to deal with the large number of stiff
non linear reaction diffusion equations. The implementation of a SDIRK scheme using a modified version of the SPIKE algorithm gives excellent parallelization results and suggests that this
implementation would also be efficient for an extension of the model to two or three dimensions.
Convergence results for a variety of SDIRK schemes show a convergence order reduction of the
numerical scheme due to the stiffness of the reaction and diffusion terms.
A comparison between simulation results using the cluster dynamics model and experimental results is essential to assess the validity of the model. Comparison with thermal helium desorption
spectrometry experiments at low flux and fluence shows an excellent agreement between simulation and experiments and indicate that the model captures the key physical properties affecting the
evolution of the tungsten microstructure. Further comparison with molecular dynamics simulations
at extremely high fluxes provides an insight in the expected limitations of the model due to surface effects and dilute limit approximations breakdown when applied to fusion relevant conditions.
Results of the model under fusion relevant conditions show the formation of large helium bubbles under the surface at a temperature dependent depth. The results are very sensitive to both
irradiation flux and temperature. At large temperatures, a small concentration of large bubbles
forms first deep under the tungsten surface, and forms a “plug” which moves towards the surface
until eventually the dilute limit approximation breaks down, indicating that the sub-surfaces bubbles become interlinked. At small temperatures, a larger concentration of smaller bubbles forms
close to the surface until eventually surface effects such as bubble bursting are expected to occur.
These results are found to be in good agreement with a similar analytical reaction diffusion model
for fusion relevant conditions. More work is needed to simulate past the dilute limit breakdown
and examine the possibility of taking into account surface effects.},

DFT calculations of activation barriers to dissociation for the clean and partially precovered surfaces, as well as quantitative analysis of TPD spectra, support that the A-type step of the (211) surface causes an upward shift in activation barriers to dissociation and lowering of the desorption barrier. The new data allow us to determine low sticking probabilities at conditions where King and Wells measurements fail to determine the reactivity. They are also fully consistent with the unexpected observation that monoatomic steps on a surface lower the reactivity toward the dissociation of a diatomic molecule.},

	title = {Self-diffusion and impurity diffusion of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus in copper},
	abstract = {A study on the mobility of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus in copper has been made.
In addition, the self-diffusion of copper has also been studied. Literature data has been reviewed,
and used to evaluate the temperature expressions of the diffusion coefficients of these elements in
copper. The interstitial elements oxygen and hydrogen have been described by a single temperature
expression in the whole temperature range, whereas the substitutional elements copper, sulphur,
and phosphorus have been modelled according to lattice diffusion at high temperatures and grain
boundary diffusion at low temperatures.
Sulphur, phosphorus, and copper are believed to be nearly immobile within the crystalline grains
at low temperature, even for time periods up to 100,000 years. On the other hand, in the grain
boundaries these elements can diffuse and an upper limit estimate of the possible diffusion distance
has been made. At room temperature sulphur can diffuse up to 5 cm for 100,000 years, whereas both
phosphorus and copper requires more than 1,000 000 years to diffuse the same distance. The oxygen
atom shows a similar mobility, although it is interstitially diffusing through the grains. However,
since both oxygen and sulphur have a very low solubility any measureable mass transport of these
elements will never take place at low temperatures. They will instead form oxides and sulphides in
the material.
Hydrogen is a mobile element, and will be able to diffuse through 5 cm of copper during a time period
of 1,000 years at room temperature. The diffusion of hydrogen in copper is experimentally well studied
down to room temperature. By combining the evaluated hydrogen diffusion coefficient with the
thermodynamically calculated hydrogen content in solid solution the permeability of hydrogen can be
explained. This can be used to explain the mass-transport of hydrogen for different times, temperatures,
and hydrogen activities (pressures).},

Results obtained were as follows:(1) The observed build-up transient of hydrogen permeation through Cu foil specimens coincided with the theoretical transient which is the boundary condition of constant hydrogen concentration directly beneath the cathodic surface. Furthermore, the specimen thickness dependence of the steady state permeation current density was examined and consequently, the diffusion of hydrogen through the Cu foil in the permeation process was the rate determining step.(2) The diffusivity in the annealed Cu did not depend on the cathodic current densities in the range of ic=2.5 to 250 A·m−2, i.e., the hydrogen concentration in the cathodic surface, but in the case of as-cold-rolled Cu, it was slightly low, when the hydrogen was introduced at low ic values. While the solubility of hydrogen beneath the cathodic surface for each specimen increased with an increase of ic value, the difference of solubility between the annealed Cu specimen and the as-cold-rolled one was not remarkable at 315±1 K.(3) The temperature dependences of the diffusivity (D) and solubility (C) of hydrogen in the annealed Cu determined at the temperature range of 292 to 339 K under ic=10 A·m−2 can be described as follows:(This article is not displayable.

In this paper, SIMS is used to observe the hydrogen desorption from copper caused by an ion bombardment, and the measurements reveal the following: hydrogen ion intensity is reduced by the industrial manufacturing procedure of copper, i.e. intermediate annealing and cold working. The less porosities the copper includes, the less hydrogen desorption it shows even though the hydrogen concentration of copper bulk is the same. The former suggests that hydrogen desorption from copper is promoted by thermal diffusion and grain boundary diffusion, and the latter suggests that the hydrogen desorption phenomena is closely related to the microstructural defects like grain boundaries or porosities that enhance the diffusion of hydrogen.

H plasma exposure leads to an embrittlement of the material and the appearance of a crack network originating from the centre of the laser spot. Under simultaneous loading, significant surface melting is observed. In general, H plasma exposure lowers the heat flux parameter (FHF) for the onset of surface melting by ∼25\%. In the case of He-modified (fuzzy) surfaces, strong surface deformations are observed already after 1000 laser pulses at moderate FHF=19MJm−2s−1/2, and a dense network of fine cracks is observed. These results indicate that high-fluence ITER-like plasma exposure influences the thermal shock properties of tungsten, lowering the permissible transient energy density beyond which macroscopic surface modifications begin to occur.},

	abstract = {Management of tritium inventory remains one of the grand challenges in the development of fusion energy, and the choice of plasma-facing materials is a key factor for in-vessel tritium retention. The Atomic and Molecular Data Unit of the International Atomic Energy Agency organized a Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on the overall topic of tritium inventory in fusion reactors during the period 2001–2006. This dealt with hydrogenic retention in ITER’s plasma-facing materials—Be, C, and W—and in compounds (mixed materials) of these elements as well as tritium removal techniques. The results of the CRP are summarized in this paper together with recommendations for ITER. Basic parameters of diffusivity, solubility, and trapping in Be, C, and W are reviewed. For Be, the development of open porosity can account for transient hydrogenic pumping, but long-term retention will be dominated by codeposition. Codeposition is also the dominant retention mechanism for carbon and remains a serious concern for both Be- and C-containing layers. Hydrogenic trapping in unirradiated tungsten is low but will increase with ion and neutron damage. Mixed materials will be formed in a tokamak, and these can also retain significant amounts of hydrogen isotopes. Oxidative and photonbased techniques for detritiation of plasma-facing components are described.},

	abstract = {During ITER operation, important flux of Hydrogen Isotopes (HIs) constituting the fuel interact with the plasma facing components (PFC) of the machine. In the case of tungsten (W) making the divertor which is the most exposed area to the plasma wall interaction, the incident flux can be implanted and diffuse inside the bulk material inducing a trapping of the fuel. To safety issue, the tritium inventory retained in ITER’s PFC is limited. In addition, the outgassing of the fuel during plasma operation can impact the edge plasma control. The aim of this PhD project is first to determined relevant trapping parameters of the fuel in W (detrapping energies/temperatures and trap concentrations) by modelling experimental results. The simulations of experimental results shows that under specific condition, the HI implantation can induce the formation of mono-vacancies containing impurities. In addition to this induced trap, 2 intrinsic traps are present in W. This 3 traps retain HIs up to 700 K. Finally, it has been shown that the damaged W by heavy ions or neutrons contains dislocations, dislocation loops and cavities that can trap HIs up to 1000 K. After determining the fuel retention properties of W, the HIs retention during ITER operation is estimated. During this operation, the PFC temperature reaches around 1000 K so the simulations show that the damaged W retains much more HIs than the undamaged W.},

Both dislocation loops and bubbles appeared from low to medium temperatures and saw an impressive increase of size (factor 4 to 6) most probably by coalescence as the temperature reaches 600 °C, with 500 °C appearing as a threshold for bubble growth. Annealing of the samples up to 800 C highlighted the stability of the dislocation damages formed by helium irradiation at high surface temperature, as bubbles and dislocation loops seem to conserve their characteristics. Additional studies on cross-sections showed that bubbles were formed much deeper (70–100 nm) than the heavily damaged surface layer (10–20 nm), raising concern about the impact on the material mechanical properties conservation and potential additional trapping of hydrogen isotopes.},

	title = {Modeling of hydrogen isotopes retention in plasma-facing components for fusion applications},
	abstract = {Plasma-material interactions might strongly affect plasma performances and life-time of future magnetic fusion devices. For example, retention and recycling of hydrogen isotopes in plasma-facing components (PFC) may lead to dynamics plasma-material interactions and significant accumulation of tritium in material. Understanding the multifaceted physics of hydrogen retention in PFC is thus crucial, but remains challenging due to the wide spectrum of retention processes on PFC surface (erosion, co- deposition, etc.) and in PFC bulk (trap sites, bubbles, etc.) induced by long-time exposure of PFC to high flux of energy and particles. In this context, we revisit in this work some aspects of the reaction-diffusion models used to describe retention of hydrogen implanted in material in fusion relevant. We first focus on the analysis of thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments, showing that the evolution of hydrogen concentration in material during TDS experiments is usually quasi-static. An analytic description of thermal desorption spectra (TDSP) is then obtained in quasi-static regime and is used to highlight dependencies of TDSP on hydrogen retention parameters. The interpretation of Arrhenius plots to characterize hydrogen retention processes is then revisited. Moreover, it is shown that retention processes can be characterized using the shape of desorption peaks in TDSP, and that long desorption tails in TDSP can be used to estimate activation energy of diffusion of hydrogen in PFC. Hydrogen retention induced by a large number of different types of traps is examined next. A reaction-diffusion model of TDSP with a large number of types of traps is presented for the first time. The application of this model is illustrated on several experimental TDSP available in literature, which are consistently reproduced using several types of traps with a unique broad spectrum of detrapping energies. The values of these detrapping energies are shown to be in agreement with values predicted by density functional theory simulations when several hydrogen atoms are trapped in one material vacancy. Effects of surface processes on hydrogen retention and recycling are investigated in the second part. First, long-term outgassing of hydrogen from PFC during off-plasma events is considered. The super- diffusive power-law decay in time of the hydrogen outgassing flux is modeled with a revisited single trap reaction-diffusion model, showing that hydrogen outgassing is either surface-limited or diffusion-limited. The outgassing regime is shown to be governed either by processes in the bulk or on the surface of material. The influence of hydrogen concentration profiles in material on the power-law exponents is analyzed as well. Finally, the different models proposed in the literature to describe power-law decays of hydrogen outgassing flux experimentally observed during off-plasma events are reconciled. Hydrogen recombination and desorption on tungsten surface is investigated next using molecular dynamics (MD) and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. Adsorption states, diffusion, hydrogen recombination into molecules, and clustering of hydrogen on tungsten surfaces are analyzed. It is shown that tungsten hydrogen interatomic potential, available in literature and used in MD simulations, cannot reproduce main features of hydrogen molecular recombination on tungsten surface. Hydrogen clustering on tungsten surface is nevertheless observed during MD simulations. Effects of hydrogen clustering on hydrogen desorption are thus analyzed by introducing a kinetic model describing the competition between surface diffusion, clustering and recombination. Different desorption regimes are identified, which reproduce some aspects of desorption regimes experimentally observed when tungsten surface is saturated with hydrogen},

In addition to other irradiation defects, the transmuted helium is believed to strongly influence material hardening and embrittlement behavior. A phenomenological model based on kinetic rate equations is developed to describe homogeneous nucleation and growth of helium bubbles in neutron irradiated RAFM steels. The model is adapted to different 10B doped EUROFER97 based heats, which already had been studied in past irradiation experiments. Simulations yield bubble size distributions, whereby effects of helium generation rate, surface energy, helium sinks and helium density are investigated. Peak bubble diameters under different conditions are compared to preliminary microstructural results on irradiated specimens. Helium induced hardening was calculated by applying the Dispersed Barrier Hardening model to simulated cluster size distributions. Quantitative microstructural investigations of unirradiated and irradiated specimens will be used to support and verify the model.},

	abstract = {Breeding blankets are designed to ensure tritium self-sufficiency in deuterium–tritium fusion power plants. In addition to this, breeder blankets play a vital role in shielding key components of the reactor, and provide the main source of heat which will ultimately be used to generate electricity. Blanket design is critical to the success of fusion reactors and integral to the design process. Neutronic simulations of breeder blankets are regularly performed to ascertain the performance of a particular design. An iterative process of design improvements and parametric studies are required to optimize the design and meet performance targets. Within the EU DEMO program the breeding blanket design cycle is repeated for each new baseline design. One of the key steps is to create three-dimensional models suitable primarily for use in neutronics, but could be used in other computer-aided design (CAD)-based physics and engineering analyses. This article presents a novel blanket design tool which automates the process of producing heterogeneous 3D CAD-based geometries of the helium-cooled pebble bed, water-cooled lithium lead, helium-cooled lithium lead and dual-coolant lithium lead blanket types. The paper shows a method of integrating neutronics, thermal analysis and mechanical analysis with parametric CAD to facilitate the design process. The blanket design tool described in this paper provides parametric geometry for use in neutronics and engineering simulations. This paper explains the methodology of the design tool and demonstrates use of the design tool by generating all four EU blanket designs using the EU DEMO baseline. Neutronics and heat transfer simulations using the models have been carried out. The approach described has the potential to considerably speed up the design cycle and greatly facilitate the integration of multiphysics studies.},

To estimate trapping energy of trap sites in this damaged W, TMAP simulation was performed. The result shows that the trapping energy of 1.29eV well accounted for the result of 250 °C annealing. In view that in the literature the vacancy trapping energy of hydrogen in tungsten was estimated to be close to 1.43 eV and the sensitivity analysis has given an uncertainty for the trapping energy of the order of 0.1 eV, it appears that the dominant trapping site type in the investigated damaged tungsten consists of vacancies.},

The review concentrates on those areas of bubble formation where the distinct chemical character of hydrogen is important. A distinction is made between nucleation and subsequent cavity growth mechanisms. Both homogeneous and heterogenous nucleation are given as possibilities. Three cavity growth mechanisms are delineated: plastic deformation near a surface referred to as “blistering”, plastic deformation by loop punching, and the collection of vacancy-hydrogen complexes. Several factors are considered which can determine the particular mechanism which applies, such as the source of the hydrogen and its concentration, solubility and diffusivity and the concentration of defects in the metal. A preemptive reaction to bubble formation is the one leading to metal hydride formation. This reaction must be considered both for predicting the formation of bubbles and for experimental observations. The possibility of plastic deformation near a free surface can lead to blistering, and this must be considered. The current understanding of loop punching processes is presented and applied to hydrogen bubble formation. Vacancy clustering may also lead to void formation which may then absorb further hydrogen-vacancy complexes. Illustrative examples of hydrogen filled cavities in selected metals and alloys are discussed in detail.},

In addition, understanding tritium retention in plasma facing materials is critical for the successful operation of ITER due to safety reasons. Thus, the question of how melting affects hydrogenic retention is highly relevant for fusion devices. Here we use an Nd:YAG laser to melt tungsten and beryllium in vacuo, and the samples are subsequently exposed to deuterium plasma with sample temperatures ranging from 370 to 750 K. The deuterium content in re-solidified and reference (no laser) samples is measured using thermal desorption spectroscopy and modeled using TMAP-7. In all cases, the re-solidified samples have lower retention compared to the reference samples. For re-solidified tungsten, the most significant effect is in the 1.8 eV trap with peak thermal desorption temperature of ∼750 K, which had a 77\% reduction in the peak release rate compared with the reference sample. SEM imaging indicates that laser melting and re-solidification of tungsten anneals intrinsic defects that act as nucleation sites for larger-scale defects that develop during plasma exposure. However, melting does not significantly affect traps with lower de-trapping energies of 1.0 eV and 1.4 eV. In beryllium, melting and cracking results in lower retention compared to the reference sample by 40\%, and thermal desorption profiles indicate that the diffusion depth of deuterium into re-solidified beryllium is lower than that of the reference sample.},

The fraction of D release increased with increasing exposure time. In addition, the D retention in n-irradiated W increased in proportion to the square root of the plasma exposure time. These observations were explained by increase in the penetration depth of D with filling up displacement damages acting as strong trapping sites.},

Ternary association rate coefficients, k3, and binary fragmentation rate coefficients, kf, were extracted from the measured temporal evolution of the hydrogen cluster ion intensity, I(Hi+), for i = 3,⋯,23. Pure para hydrogen enhances the rate coefficients for association and fragmentation. For i {\textgreater} 9 this general trend is explained by a difference in the capture cross-sections, kc, for the two hydrogen nuclear spin modifications. Significant differences in k3 which remain for small clusters (i {\textless} 9) are due to the availability of the J = 1 rotational energy of the ortho modification when merging into the cluster. This surprising result is discussed in the framework of simple dynamical and energetic considerations. Possible structures of the cluster can be classified and estimates for the bond energy of the outermost H2 in the cluster as a function of cluster size are derived.},

The present results provide thermodynamic profiles of vacancy-hydrogen clusters trapping more than six H atoms for the first time. In present work, configurational transitions of H atoms trapped in the monovacancy and activation energies for them are investigated by examining the transition paths in order to calculate configurational entropy. Vacancy-hydrogen clusters trapping more than six H atoms exist in thermodynamic equilibrium.

The surface-energy barriers for both temperatures are determined analytically with a steady-state analysis. The desorption energy per D atom from the surface is 0.69 ± 0.02 eV at 500 K and 0.87 ± 0.03 eV at 600 K. These values are in good agreement with ab initio calculations as well as experimental determination of desorption energies. The absorption energy (from the surface to the bulk) is 1.33 ± 0.04 eV at 500 K, 1.55 ± 0.02 eV at 600 K when assuming that the resurfacing energy (from the bulk to the surface) is 0.2 eV. Thermal-desorption spectrometry data after D atom exposure at 500 K and isothermal desorption at 600 K after D atom exposure at 600 K can be reproduced quantitatively with three bulk-detrapping energies, namely 1.65 ± 0.01 eV, 1.85 ± 0.03 eV and 2.06 ± 0.04 eV, in addition to the intrinsic detrapping energies known for undamaged tungsten (0.85 eV and 1.00 eV). Thanks to analyses of the amount of traps during annealing at different temperatures and ab initio calculations, the 1.65 eV detrapping energy is attributed to jogged dislocations and the 1.85 eV detrapping energy is attributed to dislocation loops. Finally, the 2.06 eV detrapping energy is attributed to D trapping in cavities based on literature reporting observations on the growth of cavities, even though this could also be understood as D desorbing from the C-D bond in the case of hydrocarbon contamination in the experimental sample.},

While such extreme environments remain inaccessible experimentally, computational modeling and simulation can provide qualitative and quantitative insights into materials response and complement the available experimental measurements with carefully validated predictions. For plasma-facing components such as the first wall and the divertor, tungsten (W) has been selected as the leading candidate material due to its superior high-temperature and irradiation properties, as well as for its low retention of implanted tritium. In this paper we provide a review of recent efforts in computational modeling of W both as a plasma-facing material exposed to He deposition as well as a bulk material subjected to fast neutron irradiation. We use a multiscale modeling approach—commonly used as the materials modeling paradigm—to define the outline of the paper and highlight recent advances using several classes of techniques and their interconnection. We highlight several of the most salient findings obtained via computational modeling and point out a number of remaining challenges and future research directions.},

The best fits are obtained with two intrinsic trap types, deep and shallow, and an extrinsic trap created by plasma irradiation and plastic deformation of the tungsten matrix associated with blister formation. We then consider a realistic cycle of plasma discharges consisting of 400s of plasma exposure followed by a resting period of 1000s, repeating for several hours. This cycle is then closed by a long “overnight” period, thus providing an estimate of the amount of tritium retained in the PFCs after a full day of standard operation.},

	abstract = {A reaction-diffusion model with surface occupation dependent desorption [D. Matveev et al., Nucl. Instr. Meth. B 430 (2018) 23–30] has been updated to handle multiple hydrogen species to simulate hydrogen/deuterium isotope-exchange experiments performed on polycrystalline beryllium samples under ultra-high vacuum laboratory conditions. In the experiments subsequent exposures of a sample to hydrogen and deuterium ion beams in direct and reverse implantation order were followed by thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements under a constant heating rate of 0.7 K/s. The recorded signals of masses 2 to 4 (H2, HD and D2) indicate that the second implanted isotope dominates clearly the low temperature release stage ( ≈ 450 K), while both isotopes show a comparable contribution to the high temperature desorption stage ( ≈ 700 K) with only minor effect of the implantation order attributed to a slightly deeper penetration of deuterium compared to hydrogen. Simulations of the implantation and subsequent thermal desorption of hydrogen isotopes are performed to assess the atomic processes behind the isotope-exchange. Simulations were performed under the assumption that the low temperature release stage is attributed to hydrogen/deuterium atoms retained on effective open surfaces (e.g. interconnected porosity) represented in the simulations by a surface with an effective surface area exceeding the nominal exposed surface area by a factor up to 100. Kinetic de-trapping from vacancies with multiple trapping levels and enhanced desorption at surface coverages close to saturation are addressed in the model as possible mechanisms promoting the isotope-exchange. Simulation results suggest the applicability of the model to describe isotope-exchange processes in crystalline beryllium and give a qualitative explanation of the observed experimental facts.},

Three types of traps are found: two intrinsic traps (detrapping energy of 0.87 eV and 1.00 eV) and one extrinsic trap created by ion irradiation (detrapping energy of 1.50 eV). Then MHIMS is used to simulate HIs retention at different fluences and different implantation temperatures. Simulation results agree well with experimental data. It is shown that at 300 K the retention is limited by diffusion in the bulk. For implantation temperatures above 500 K, the retention is limited by trap creation processes. Above 600 K, the retention drops by two orders of magnitude as compared to the retention at 300 K. With the determined detrapping energies, HIs outgassing at room temperature is predicted. After ions implantation at 300 K, 45\% of the initial retention is lost to vacuum in 300 000 s while during this time the remaining trapped HIs diffuse twice as deep into the bulk.},

	abstract = {Simulating the implantation and thermal desorption evolution in a reaction-diffusion model requires solving a set of coupled differential equations that describe the trapping and release of atomic species in Plasma Facing Materials (PFMs). These fundamental equations are well outlined by the Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP) which can model systems with no more than three active traps per atomic species. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a Pseudo Trap and Temperature Partition (PTTP) scheme allowing us to lump multiple inactive traps into one pseudo trap, simplifying the system of equations to be solved. For all temperatures, we show the trapping of atoms from solute is exactly accounted for when using a pseudo trap. However, a single effective pseudo trap energy can not well replicate the release from multiple traps, each with its own detrapping energy. However, atoms held in a high energy trap will remain trapped at relatively low temperatures, and thus there is a temperature range in which release from high energy traps is effectively inactive. By partitioning the temperature range into segments, a pseudo trap can be defined for each segment to account for multiple high energy traps that are actively trapping but are effectively not releasing atoms. With increasing temperature, as in controlled thermal desorption, the lowest energy trap is nearly emptied and can be removed from the set of coupled equations, while the next higher energy trap becomes an actively releasing trap. Each segment is thus calculated sequentially, with the last time step of a given segment solution being used as an initial input for the next segment as only the pseudo and actively releasing traps are modeled. This PTTP scheme is then applied to experimental thermal desorption data for tungsten (W) samples damaged with heavy ions, which display six distinct release peaks during thermal desorption. Without modifying the TMAP7 source code the PTTP scheme is shown to successfully model the D retention in all six traps. We demonstrate the full reconstruction from the plasma implantation phase through the controlled thermal desorption phase with detrapping energies near 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 1.9 and 2.1 eV for a W sample damaged at room temperature.},

Two grades of materials are considered to be exposed to tritium ions: an undamaged W and a damaged W exposed to fast fusion neutrons. Due to strong temperature gradient in the PFC, Soret effect’s impacts on tritium retention is also evaluated for both cases. Thanks to the simulation, the evolutions of the tritium retention and the tritium migration depth are obtained as a function of the implanted flux and the number of cycles. From these evolutions, extrapolation laws are built to estimate the number of cycles needed for tritium to permeate from the implantation zone to the cooled surface and to quantify the corresponding retention of tritium throughout the W PFC.},

Simulations and extrapolations from existing experiments indicate that T-retention in ITER will mainly be driven by co-deposition with beryllium (Be) eroded from the first wall, with co-deposits forming mainly in the divertor region but also possibly on the first wall itself. A pulsed Laser-Induced Desorption (LID) system, called Tritium Monitor, is being designed to locally measure the T-retention in co-deposits forming on the inner divertor baffle of ITER. Regarding tritium removal, the baseline strategy is to perform baking of the plasma-facing components, at 513K for the FW and 623K for the divertor. Both baking and laser desorption rely on the thermal desorption of tritium from the surface, the efficiency of which remains unclear for thick (and possibly impure) co-deposits. This contribution reports on the results of TMAP7 studies of this efficiency for ITER-relevant deposits.},

	abstract = {In the European strategy, DEMO is the intermediate step between ITER and a commercial fusion power plant. In this framework, one of the goal of DEMO is to be a Breeding Blanket test facility. The Breeding Blanket, which is not present in ITER, is one of the key components for the future deployment of nuclear fusion electricity as it accomplishes the functions of tritium breeding and nuclear to thermal power conversion. Due to time constraints lead by the construction schedule of DEMO, a new strategy to consider in DEMO a “driver” Breeding Blanket that needs limited technological extrapolation has been chosen, while “advanced” Breeding Blanket concepts will be tested in the next phases. In this context, ITER will allow to test technologies to provide relevant contributions in terms of Return of eXperience to the DEMO “driver” Breeding Blanket project by the mean of Test Blanket Modules (TBM) to be installed in different ITER Vacuum Vessel Ports. Among the possible “driver” Breeding Blanket, the Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) concept comes out. In this framework, a realignment of the DEMO Breeding Blanket and TBM programs has started in 2017, leading to a new TBM development relevant of the DEMO WCLL BB. The WCLL TBM is therefore an essential component in ITER that will provide crucial information for the development of the DEMO “driver” blanket. This paper aims at presenting the development process and design status of WCLL TBM. After recalling the main features of the WCLL TBM, conceptual design analyses are presented and discussed.},

One of the key components in the fusion reactor is the Breeding Blanket (BB) surrounding the plasma, ensuring tritium self-sufficiency, heat removal for conversion into electricity, and neutron shielding. CEA-Saclay, with the support of Wigner-RCP and Centrum výzkumu Řež, is in charge of the development of one of the four BB concepts investigated in Europe for DEMO: the Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) BB. The rationales of the HCLL are the use of Eurofer as structural material, eutectic liquid lithium-lead (PbLi) as tritium breeder and neutron multiplier, and helium gas as coolant. This paper shows the basic description of the DEMO HCLL BB concept and its design evolution during the past years, from a design based on the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) concept to a more advanced design called “Advanced-Plus” concept. This new HCLL BB concept that has been designed in order to improve Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) and shielding performances is presented. This new reference HCLL BB design has been analyzed and show very promising nuclear performances. Nevertheless, the “Optimized Conservative” concept, based on ITER TBM, is still considered as a robust back-up solution since structural improvements are still necessary on the “Advanced-Plus” concept. Moreover, a new Back Supporting Structure (BSS) is presented in this paper, designed to support the BB modules, with the aim to reduce pressure drops and thermal stresses.},

Several BB concepts are being studied, among which the Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) one. SYCOMORE includes several specific modules in Python linked together, one of which has been developed to define a suitable design of the WCLL Breeding Blanket and is presented in this paper. The method to define automatically the WCLL First Wall (FW) design using analytical design formulae starting from thermo-hydraulic and thermo-mechanical considerations as well as design criteria coming from Codes \& Standards (C\&S) is presented. Furthermore WCLL FW design obtained with SYCOMORE is compared to Finite Elements (FE) analyses of the DEMO WCLL BB. Finally, a coupling between thermo-mechanics and neutronics is implemented, several iterations are necessary to obtain a converged design. Neutronic block evaluates the radial build, the BB tritium production, and the nuclear heating in the FW and the Breeding Zone (used by thermo-mechanical block). Thermo-mechanical module gives the design data (FW thickness, compositions, etc.) to the neutronic block.},

	abstract = {The lifetime of tungsten (W) monoblocks under fusion conditions is ambivalent. In this work, the microstructure dependent mechanical behaviour of pulsed high heat flux (HHF) exposed W monoblock is investigated. Two different microstructural states, i.e. initial (deformed) and recrystallized, both machined from HHF exposed monoblocks are tested using tensile and small punch tests. The initial microstructural state reveals a higher fraction of low angle boundaries along with a preferred orientation of crystals. Following HHF exposure, the recrystallized state exhibits weakening of initial texture along with a higher fraction of high angle boundaries. Irrespective of the testing methodology, both the microstructural states display brittle failure for temperatures lower than 400∘C. For higher temperatures ({\textgreater}400∘C), the recrystallized microstructure exhibits more ductile behaviour as compared to the initial state. The observed microstructural state-dependent mechanical behaviour is further discussed in terms of different microstructural features. The estimated brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (BDTT) range is noticed to be lower for the recrystallized state as compared to the initial state. The lower BDTT in the recrystallized state is attributed to the high purity of the W in combination with its low defect density, thereby preventing segregation of impurities at the recrystallized boundaries and the related premature failure. Based on this observation, it is concluded that the common opinion of the aggravation of BDTT in W due to recrystallization is not unerring, and as a matter of fact, recrystallization in W could be instrumental for preventing the self-castellation of the monoblocks.},

	abstract = {A parametric study is performed with the 2D FESTIM code for the ITER monoblock geometry. The influence of the monoblock surface temperature, the incident ion energy and particle flux on the monoblock hydrogen inventory is investigated. The simulated data is analysed with a Gaussian regression process and an inventory map as a function of ion energy and incident flux is given. Using this inventory map, the hydrogen inventory in the divertor is easily derived for any type of scenario. Here, the case of a detached ITER scenario with inputs from the SOLPS code is presented. For this scenario, the hydrogen inventory per monoblock is highly dependent of surface temperature and ranges from \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$\$1018to \$\$6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$\$6×1019H after a \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$\$107s exposure. The inventory evolves as a power law of time and is lower at strike points where the surface temperature is high. Hydrogen inventory in the whole divertor after a \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$\$107s exposure is estimated at approximately 8 g.},

A comparison test between FESTIM, TMAP7 and Abaqus codes is also performed and the codes show good agreement. The chemical potential continuity condition has an impact up to 40\% on the outgassing particle flux on {\textbackslash}SI4mm composite slabs (W/Cu and Cu/EUROFER) compared to mobile concentration continuity. A method for rapid identification of materials properties from outgassing flux measurements is given. The influence of chemical potential conservation on monoblock inventory is then studied.

	abstract = {Fusion energy is often regarded as a long-term solution to the world's energy needs. However, even after solving the critical research challenges, engineering and materials science will still impose significant constraints on the characteristics of a fusion power plant. Meanwhile, the global energy grid must transition to low-carbon sources by 2050 to prevent the worst effects of climate change. We review three factors affecting fusion's future trajectory: (1) the significant drop in the price of renewable energy, (2) the intermittency of renewable sources and implications for future energy grids, and (3) the recent proposition of intermediate-level nuclear waste as a product of fusion. Within the scenario assumed by our premises, we find that while there remains a clear motivation to develop fusion power plants, this motivation is likely weakened by the time they become available. We also conclude that most current fusion reactor designs do not take these factors into account and, to increase market penetration, fusion research should consider relaxed nuclear waste design criteria, raw material availability constraints and load-following designs with pulsed operation.},

Benchmark calculations give a reasonable agreement on the co-permeation rates with the experimental data. Simulation in a TBM unit show that purge gas flow can strongly affect tritium transport, increasing the purge flow velocity is an effective method to reduce tritium permeation to the coolant. In the case where hydrogen is added to the purge gas stream to promote tritium release, the co-permeation of H2, T2, and HT are taken into account in the permeation simulation, results show that permeation flux of T–T molecules is reduced due to the effect of co-permeation of hydrogen.},

Equations and boundary conditions required for hydrogen isotopes transport are implemented. Realistic properties data as diffusion constants and Sieverts constants are required, too. A key model issue is solid-fluid interface mass transfer. Two correlations that (1) approaches Sieverts equilibrium in the diffusion limit and (2) a rate dependent correlation that includes the diffusion limit for very high ad-/desorption rate constants are introduced. A two species interface mass transfer correlation based on the single species rate dependent correlation is developed, too.

In the present work, a multi-physics 3D tritium transport model has been assessed for a single breeder unit located in the outboard equatorial module of the Water-Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) breeding blanket of DEMO, adopting an approach that permits to have a modelling tool able to be adaptive within certain margins to changes in operating parameters and geometry. The transport has been modelled considering advection-diffusion of tritium into the lead-lithium eutectic alloy, transfer of tritium from the liquid interface towards the steel (adsorption/desorption), diffusion of tritium inside the steel, transfer of tritium from the steel towards the coolant (recombination/dissociation), advection-diffusion of diatomic tritium into the coolant. The effect of buoyancy forces, which arise due to temperature variation, has been also considered. Under the above-specified phenomena, tritium concentrations, inventories and losses have been derived.},

	abstract = {The Water-Cooled Lithium-Lead (WCLL) is one of the four breeding blanket concepts proposed by Europe in view of its DEMO reactor. The velocity field of the electrically conducting lead-lithium eutectic alloy inside the blanket is strongly influenced by the external magnetic field used for plasma confinement combined with buoyancy effect. The strength of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effect and of the magneto-convective effect (MHD and buoyancy force) depends on the intensity of the magnetic field and its orientation with respect to the direction of the lead-lithium motion. This phenomenon significantly influences the resulting temperature and velocity fields, and therefore the tritium transport inside the breeding blanket. A multi-physics approach of a 3D tritium transport model is presented for a simplified geometry of the WCLL breeding blanket. In particular, advection-diffusion of tritium into the lead-lithium eutectic alloy, transfer of tritium from the liquid interface towards the steel, diffusion of tritium inside the steel, transfer of tritium from the steel towards the coolant, and advection-diffusion of diatomic tritium into the coolant, temperature field, velocity fields of both lead-lithium and water, buoyancy forces, and MHD effect have been included in this study. The tritium concentrations and the inventories inside the lead-lithium, in the Eurofer pipes and in the baffle, and in the water coolant have been evaluated.},

Its aim is to characterize, in the range of operating conditions foreseen for the European Test Blanket System WCLL-TBS, several extraction technologies for hydrogen isotopes (Q2) solubilized in the flowing metallic LiPb alloy (15.7 at. \% Li). One of these technologies is the packed column, an example of Gas/Liquid Contactors (GLCs). This paper proposes a multiscale modelling tool, combining different scales through two computational tools. The extraction column mock-up is described by a component-detail level model, developed in COMSOL Multiphysics, and integrated into a system level code of the whole TRIEX-II circuit, developed using MATLAB/Simulink. The integration is carried out by implementing the COMSOL component into an S-function of MATLAB/Simulink, preserving the process flow diagram of the loop. In this way, it was possible to quantify the Q2 concentrations and the permeation fluxes, and to evaluate the theoretical extraction efficiency. The LiPb flow field inside the extractor was also derived. Finally, a comparison with the experimental results was performed. The results suggest that this tool could be adapted for analyses of complex systems, at a multiscale level, in view of design improvements and safety studies for the tritium cycle of ITER.},

The results, such as dynamic change of tritium concentration/partial pressure in fluids, dynamic change of tritium inventory in solids, tritium permeation fluxes etc., have been obtained, which are preliminary verified at various aspects by comparing with analytical and hand calculations.},

The aim of this work is to develop a model that can dynamically track tritium concentrations and fluxes along each part of the DCLL blanket and the ancillary systems associated to it at any time. Because of tritium nature, the phenomena of diffusion, dissociation, recombination and solubilisation have been modeled in order to describe the interaction between the lead-lithium channels, the structural material, the flow channel inserts and the helium channels that are present in the breeding blanket. Results have been obtained for a pulsed generation scenario for DEMO. The tritium inventory in different parts of the blanket, the permeation rates from the breeder to the secondary coolant and the amount of tritium extracted from the lead-lithium loop have been computed. Results present an oscillating behavior around mean values. The obtained average permeation rate from the liquid metal to the helium is 1.66 mg while the mean tritium inventory in the whole system is 417 mg. Besides the reference case results, parametric studies of the lead-lithium mass flow rate, the tritium extraction efficiency and the tritium solubility in lead-lithium have been performed showing the reaction of the system to the variation of these parameters.},

	abstract = {In this paper, advancement on tritium transport simulations was demonstrated for a solid breeder blanket HCCR TBS, where multi-physics and detailed engineering descriptions are considered using a commercial simulation code. The physics involved includes compressible purge gas fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reaction, isotope swamping effect, and tritium isotopes mass transport. The strategy adopted here is to develop numerical procedures and techniques that allow critical details of material, geometric and operational heterogeneity in a most complete engineering description of the TBS being incorporated into the simulation. Our application focuses on the transient assessment in view of ITER being pulsed operations. An immediate advantage is a more realistic predictive and design analysis tool accounting pulsed operations induced temperature variations which impact helium purge gas flow as well as Q2 composition concentration time and space evolutions in the breeding regions. This affords a more accurate prediction of tritium permeation into the He coolant by accounting correct temperature and partial pressure effects and realistic diffusion paths. The analysis also shows that by introducing by-pass line to accommodate ITER pulsed operations in the TES loop allows tritium extraction design being more cost effective.},

Safety considerations are also taken into account. A finite element model (FEM) for tritium permeation was developed considering various phenomena such as tritium transport by convection and diffusion in lithium–lead, MHD effects on liquid metal flows, tritium permeation in structures with temperature gradients. Other sub-system performances, like He leak rate and efficiency of tritium extraction systems, are discussed via an engineering approach. The results show that a reasonable compromise among the various requirements can be found, leading to technologically achievable requirements for tritium permeation barriers, tritium extraction systems both from Pb–17Li and He, and leak rates from the He cooling system.},

	abstract = {During the conceptual design process of fusion reactors it is useful to rapidly prototype different design concepts and assess their suitability against a range of high level requirements. Rapid prototyping allows the 'fail early' mantra of other fields to be applied to engineering design.
            Furthermore, the rapid generation of low fidelity analysis allows fast exploration of design space, which enables better decisions to be made during concept selection and the detailed design phase. The Paramak is an open-source tool that aims to provide automated parameter driven 3D CAD models for fusion reactor components and magnetic fusion reactors. The geometry produced is compatible with several analysis workflows and this allows iterative automated model building and analysis to help steer the design concept optimisation process. The Paramak uses CadQuery 2 to create the 3D CAD model. The Paramak framework is used to create a few example reactor configurations including: a spherical reactor, a regular large radius tokamak and a compact submersion tank reactor. Input parameters for the various reactors that the Paramak can generate generally fall into three categories: continuous ranges such as blanket thickness, integer ranges such as number of toroidal field coils and categorical parameters such as type of divertor. The Paramak facilitates parameter studies where users can investigate the impact of input design parameters on the reactor performance. The use of modern software practices allows the geometry to be continuously tested in analysis workflows to ensure it is fit for purpose. The generation of output metrics from input parameters lends itself to the use of data science and machine learning approaches in order to steer the design. The Paramak provides rapid construction of analysis ready CAD in a manner that allows the designer to save time when exploring the design space for design studies and facilitate automated generative design.},

	abstract = {The anticipated heat flux limit of the European DEMO first wall is ∼1−2 MW/m2. During transient and off normal events, the heat load deposited on the wall would be much larger than the steady state heat load and exceed the first wall limit, therefore the breeding blanket first wall needs to be protected. This involves dedicated discrete limiters in certain regions of the machine that would take the brunt of the heat load as well as adequate shaping of the first wall. The current concept envisages limiters at a few (3–4) equatorial ports to cope with the ramp-up of the plasma; upper limiters (in ∼8 upper ports) are considered for upward vertical displacement events. Two design options have been considered for these limiters: a modular design where the limiter plasma facing components are attached to individual plates that are assembled together so that transient electromagnetic loads can be reduced, and in case of damage the plates can be replaced/repaired individually; and a divertor-like design where the plasma facing components are attached to a single Eurofer cassette. Other limiters considered include inner wall limiters in case of plasma contraction and lower limiters may be needed for downward vertical displacement events. The thermal hydraulic finite element analysis results show that the integrity of the cooling pipes can be maintained during the anticipated transient events. The limiters are considered to be sacrificial and designed to be replaceable independently from the breeding blanket system. The design has to allow that installation, removal or replacement of the limiters can be performed remotely. Strategy to tackle outstanding issues and required R\&D is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A model for the interaction of hydrogen with metals is discussed which includes the surface concentration and the surface potential and is based on the observation that molecular hydrogen is dissociated before it is chemisorbed at a metal surface. It is shown that an activation barrier for dissociation of molecular hydrogen at the metal surface leads to an enhanced solubility and increased permeation rate of hydrogen in a metal exposed to atomic hydrogen as compared to molecular hydrogen. The sticking probability of molecular hydrogen on clean transition metals has been measured in the past and shown to be of the order of unity. As no activation barrier is present no difference is expected between atomic and molecular hydrogen. Whenever large differences have been observed in the past they must be attributed to an impurity contamination of the metal surface. Substantial reductions of the sticking probability due to dissociation barriers have been found for metals contaminated with less than one monolayer of electronegative impurities. We compare our model with earlier descriptions of hydrogen metal interactions. A theoretical expression is derived for the “recombination rate constant”. Furthermore we discuss implications of our model on hydrogen permeation (“super permeation”) as well as hydrogen pumping and pumping panels in tokamaks.},

The last function is fulfilled by First Wall and Breeding Zone independent cooling systems. Several layouts of BZ coolant system have been investigated in the last years to identify a configuration that might guarantee EUROFER temperature below the limit (550 °C) and good thermal-hydraulic performances (i.e. water outlet temperature of 328 °C). A research activity is conducted to study and compare different modelling approaches to simulate the heat transfer within the BZ liquid metal, assessing their impact on the numerical prediction of the WCLL blanket thermal performances. An approach will rely on the simulation of convective and diffusive heat transfer processes taking place within the liquid metal by means of a CFD tool based on the Finite Volume Method. Conversely, the other approach will roughly assume a pure diffusive heat transfer mechanism within the breeder, due to the very low velocities envisaged for its flow field. In this case the heat transfer performances will be preferably assessed by means of a commercial code based on the Finite Element Method. The analyses have been carried out with reference to the so called “WCLL BB 2018 V0.6″ equatorial cell. Advantages and issues from the thermal-hydraulic point of view are identified, the impact of the imposed boundary conditions and heat transfer properties, with the implemented correlations, on the respective results is critically discussed.},

These are not intended to represent fixed and exclusive design choices but rather ‘proxies’ of possible plant design options to be used to identify generic design/material issues that need to be resolved in future fusion reactor systems. The materials nuclear design requirements and the effects of radiation damage are briefly analysed with emphasis on a pulsed ‘low extrapolation’ system, which is being used for the initial design integration studies, based as far as possible on mature technologies and reliable regimes of operation (to be extrapolated from the ITER experience), and on the use of materials suitable for the expected level of neutron fluence. The main technical issues arising from the plasma and nuclear loads and the effects of radiation damage particularly on the structural and heat sink materials of the vessel and in-vessel components are critically discussed. The need to establish realistic target performance and a development schedule for near-term electricity production tends to favour more conservative technology choices. The readiness of the technical (physics and technology) assumptions that are being made is expected to be an important factor for the selection of the technical features of the device.},

	abstract = {The current breeding blankets proposed in the different conceptual fusion power plants are based mainly on the use of Li4SiO4 and/or Li2TiO3 as tritium breeder and Be/Be12Ti as neutron multiplier or an eutectic Li17Pb83 for as a hybrid tritium and neutron multiplier. While these materials offer some tritium breeding capabilities, some recent studies show that the tritium self-sufficiency may not be ensured with these materials due to the strong reduction of blanket coverage after the integration of other in-vessel reactor systems (heating and current drive, limiters, large or double-null divertor systems, etc.). Also, some materials like Be raises several key feasibility concerns. The goal of this paper is to perform an update of the screening for tritium breeder and neutron multiplier materials and to assess the tritium breeding performance of the selected compounds in order to reveal new options. As for the neutron multiplier materials, a new subdivision between solid and liquid multipliers is proposed. For the selected compounds, detailed 3D heterogeneous neutronic analyses have been performed with MCNP5-1.60 assuming the architecture of the current EU DEMO Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) as a benchmark breeding blanket. From the point of view of ceramic breeders, Li8ZrO6 has been found to outperform Li4SiO4 by more than 4\% in terms of tritium breeding, having 6\% higher melting point. From the point of view of solid neutron multipliers, Be12Cr, Be12V, Be13Zr and Be13Y show a similar performance as Be12Ti, while LaPb3, Zr5Pb4 and YPb2 offer a solution for a Be-free blanket. As for liquid multipliers, Pb in combination with a ceramic breeder shows a very promising option. Moreover, Pb compounds like Pb90Mn10 and Pb95Ba5 offer similar performance as Pb with a lower melting point (290 °C). Due to the significant advantages of molten Pb as neutron multiplier, future work will be conducted to define a design of a helium cooled Molten Lead Ceramic Breeder blanket, as simple, cost effective blanket concept.},

	abstract = {The major increase in discharge duration and plasma energy in a next step DT fusion reactor will give rise to important plasma-material effects that will critically influence its operation, safety and performance. Erosion will increase to a scale of several centimetres from being barely measurable at a micron scale in today's tokamaks. Tritium co-deposited with carbon will strongly affect the operation of machines with carbon plasma facing components. Controlling plasma-wall interactions is critical to achieving high performance in present day tokamaks, and this is likely to continue to be the case in the approach to practical fusion reactors. Recognition of the important consequences of these phenomena stimulated an internationally co-ordinated effort in the field of plasma-surface interactions supporting the Engineering Design Activities of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project (ITER), and significant progress has been made in better understanding these issues. The paper reviews the underlying physical processes and the existing experimental database of plasma-material interactions both in tokamaks and laboratory simulation facilities for conditions of direct relevance to next step fusion reactors. Two main topical groups of interaction are considered: (i) erosion/redeposition from plasma sputtering and disruptions, including dust and flake generation and (ii) tritium retention and removal. The use of modelling tools to interpret the experimental results and make projections for conditions expected in future devices is explained. Outstanding technical issues and specific recommendations on potential R\&D avenues for their resolution are presented.},

Results demonstrate that for all the four kinds of steels, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) increases with irradiation dose. The difference in the DBTT shifts (ΔDBTT) of the different steels is not significant after irradiation in the SINQ target. The ΔDBTT data from the previous small punch (Δ DBTTSP) and the present Charpy impact (ΔDBTTCVN) tests can be correlated with the expression: Δ DBTTSP=0.4ΔDBTTCVN. All the ΔDBTT data fall into a linear band when they are plotted versus helium concentration. The results indicate that helium effects on the embrittlement of MF steels are significant, particularly at higher concentrations. It suggests that MF steels may not be very suitable for applications at low temperatures in spallation irradiation environments where helium production is high.},

A tritium transport model is fundamental for the correct assessment of both design and safety, in order to guarantee tritium self-sufficiency and to characterize tritium concentrations, inventories and losses. The present 2D transport model takes into account a single breeder unit located in the outboard equatorial module of the HCLL breeding blanket, which is one of the most loaded modules in normal operating conditions. A multi-physics approach has been adopted considering several physics phenomena, providing for buoyancy effect, temperature fields, tritium generation rate and velocity profile of lead-lithium and coolant. The transport has been modelled considering advection-diffusion of tritium into the lead-lithium eutectic alloy, transfer of tritium from the liquid interface towards the steel (adsorption/desorption), diffusion of tritium inside the steel, transfer of tritium from the steel towards the coolant (recombination/desorption), advection-diffusion of diatomic tritium into the coolant. Tritium concentrations, inventories and losses have been derived under the above specified phenomena. In particular, the effect of buoyancy forces on the tritium transport has been implemented and compared with the condition without buoyancy.},

The irradiation response of ferritic steels with respect to microstructural evolution, swelling, irradiation hardening, irradiation embrittlement, and irradiation creep are highlighted. The main concerns of ferritic steels such as the inferior high temperature irradiation creep and severe embrittlement are addressed.

In this connection, peculiarities of helium porosity formation and gaseous swelling have been investigated in the dispersion-strengthened EP-450 ODS steel with 0.3 and 1 wt.\% Y2O3 dispersant produced by spark plasma sintering (SPS) as compared with the matrix EP-450 steel, EP-450 ODS steel produced using a hot extrusion (HE) as well as reactor austenitic ChS-68 steel. The samples were irradiated by 40-keV Не+ ions at 923 K up to fluence of 5 × 1020 ion/m2. Microstructural investigations of irradiated samples were performed using a transmission electron microscope. It is found that plurality of zones with a very different type of helium porosity and different character of their distribution is developed in steel with 1 wt.\% Y2O3. Such zones are less in steel with 0.3 wt.\% Y2O3 as opposed to matrix EP-450 steel, EP-450 ODS steel obtained by HE, and austenitic ChS-68 reactor steel. It is found in comparing the character of helium porosity formation in the matrix steel EP-450, steel EP-450 ODS (HE) and EP-450 ODS (SPS) that bubbles are developed with a smaller average sizes and, therefore, helium swelling is lower in all ODS steels than that in steel EP-450, but for ODS steel made by SPS, swelling is significantly higher than in ODS steel produced by hot extrusion. At the same time, austenitic steel ChS-68 shows a minimum gaseous swelling for the used conditions of helium ion irradiation. An assumption is made that the extremely nonuniform distribution of helium bubbles (gas filled pores) both in volume and size in SPS steel is associated with the initially highly defect structure, including the residual porosity in 1–3\% as well as a result of strong redistribution of chromium between ferritic grains and grains of tempered martensite during manufacturing of samples.},

In this research, the helium-ion accumulation concomitant with displacement damage induced by helium and iron ions irradiation in China low active martensitic (CLAM) steel was studied by ion-irradiation, transmission electron microscopy and nano-indentation technique. The helium bubbles formed under continuous implantation of helium ions at room temperature and the helium dose forming observed bubbles resolved by TEM clearly in CLAM steel is around 0.7 × 1017–1.0 × 1017 He+/cm2 under single 100 keV He+ irradiation. Significant irradiation hardening was observed in the samples with various ion- and dose-irradiations. Positive correlation between the hardening increment and the helium-ion dose has been established in single helium-ion irradiated samples. On the other hand, the subsequent Fe-ion irradiation greatly promoted the formation and growth of helium bubbles as well as dislocation loops in sequential dual-ion irradiated samples. No significant contribution of the subsequent Fe-ion irradiation on the hardness increment was found for the sequential dual-ion irradiated samples. It is suggested that the defects recombination, the combination effects of size and density of defects contribute to the degree of irradiation hardening. The calculated hardness increment based on dispersion strengthening model and the experimental microstructure analysis followed the same trend as the experimental nano-indentation data.},

Although fission and fusion materials exhibit common features, fusion materials research is broader. The harder mono-energetic spectrum associated with the deuterium–tritium fusion neutrons (14.1 MeV compared to {\textless}2 MeV on average for fission neutrons) releases significant amounts of hydrogen and helium as transmutation products that might lead to a (at present undetermined) degradation of structural materials after a few years of operation. Overcoming the historical lack of a fusion-relevant neutron source for materials testing is an essential pending step in fusion roadmaps.

Then, it was exposed to a probe fluence of 1019 D/m2 of 2 keV D3+ (670 eV/D) ions, and in-situ TDS was performed. The de-trapping energy for D atoms increased with the increase of the He pre-irradiation fluence. On the other hand, a strong decrease in the D retention was observed if the He fluence increased above 1021 He/m2. At the highest He fluence of 5 × 1021 He/m2 deuterium trapping was possible only after partial release of He atoms. By comparison of experimental TDS spectra with modelling, the de-trapping energies of D atoms from various defects were estimated.},

	abstract = {A critical analysis is presented of the operating temperature windows for nine candidate fusion reactor structural materials: four reduced-activation structural materials (oxide-dispersion-strengthened and ferritic/martensitic steels containing 8–12\%Cr, V–4Cr–4Ti, and SiC/SiC composites), copper-base alloys (CuNiBe), tantalum-base alloys (e.g. Ta–8W–2Hf), niobium alloys (Nb–1Zr), and molybdenum and tungsten alloys. The results are compared with the operating temperature limits for Type 316 austenitic stainless steel. Several factors define the allowable operating temperature window for structural alloys in a fusion reactor. The lower operating temperature limit in all body-centered cubic (BCC) and most face-centered cubic (FCC) alloys is determined by radiation embrittlement (decrease in fracture toughness), which is generally most pronounced for irradiation temperatures below ∼0.3 TM where TM is the melting temperature. The lower operating temperature limit for SiC/SiC composites will likely be determined by radiation-induced thermal conductivity degradation, which becomes more pronounced in ceramics with decreasing temperature. The upper operating temperature limit of structural materials is determined by one of four factors, all of which become more pronounced with increasing exposure time: (1) thermal creep (grain boundary sliding or matrix diffusional creep); (2) high temperature He embrittlement of grain boundaries; (3) cavity swelling (particularly important for SiC and Cu alloys); or (4) coolant compatibility/corrosion issues. In many cases, the upper temperature limit will be determined by coolant corrosion/compatibility rather than by thermal creep or radiation effects. The compatibility of the structural materials with Li, Pb–Li, Sn–Li, He and Flibe (Li2BeF4) coolants is summarized.},

In the case of a gaseous reduction method, size control is difficult due to the agglomeration of nickel powders. Therefore, a method of producing highly-valued nickel nano-powders from Ni(OH)2 has been proposed. Considering the reduction behavior of bulk nickel oxide has been reported to follow the topo-chemical model. However, reduction behavior of nano-particle is expected to be unknown state. It is necessary to clarify the mechanism of nickel oxide nano-particle reduction. Therefore, in this study, the temperature dependence and particle size dependence on the reduction behavior of from micro scale to nano scale particle was confirmed through TGA experiment. Also, the reduction mechanism of nickel oxide powder was also investigated based on kinetic considerations using the grain topo-chemical model. It was confirmed that the reduction reaction of nickel oxide powder undergoes through the 2nd Avrami model and reduction rate can be expressed by function of temperature and particle size of the powder. Due to the part of the diffusion, the particle size of the powder also affects the rate constant of the reduction reaction.\$\$\{{\textbackslash}text\{g\}\}\_\{\{(\{{\textbackslash}text\{x\}\})\}\} = \{{\textbackslash}text\{k\}\} {\textbackslash}cdot \{{\textbackslash}text\{f\}\}(\{{\textbackslash}text\{d\}\}) {\textbackslash}cdot \{{\textbackslash}text\{t\}\}\$\$g(x)=k·f(d)·t},

Radiation damage usually leads to detrimental effects such as embrittlement, accelerated creep, phase instability, and radiation-altered corrosion. Here we report that proton irradiation decelerates intergranular corrosion of Ni-Cr alloys in molten fluoride salt at 650 °C. We demonstrate this by showing that the depth of intergranular voids resulting from Cr leaching into the salt is reduced by proton irradiation alone. Interstitial defects generated from irradiation enhance diffusion, more rapidly replenishing corrosion-injected vacancies with alloy constituents, thus playing the crucial role in decelerating corrosion. Our results show that irradiation can have a positive impact on materials performance, challenging our view that radiation damage usually results in negative effects.},

	abstract = {The Water-Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) breeding blanket is one of the European blanket designs proposed for DEMO reactor. Tritium can permeate into the different structural materials, arising potential issues concerning the fuel self-sufficiency and can be lost into the environment with consequent radiological hazard for the population. Within this frame, a tritium transport analysis is fundamental to evaluate tritium retention in LiPb (15.7 at. \% Li) and in the structures and tritium permeation fluxes into the cooling water. To assess this study, a portion of the breeder unit of the outboard equatorial module of the WCLL was modelled. The buoyancy forces and the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect were also included. The final system of partial differential equations was solved with a novel approach through COMSOL Multiphysics. The coupled MHD and heat transfer system of equations was solved performing a transient simulation, that was stopped when the main average variables, temperature and velocity, reached a stable condition. In this way, it was possible to determine the lithium-lead velocity field and to use it as an input for the transport analysis. Tritium transport was modelled by using the input data of tritium generation rate and volumetric power deposition coming from an ad-hoc Monte Carlo simulation realized with MCNP software. Moreover, the transport analysis included advection-diffusion of tritium into the LiPb, transfer of tritium from the liquid interface towards the steel, diffusion of tritium inside the steel, transfer of tritium from the steel towards the coolant, advection-diffusion of diatomic tritium into the coolant.},

	abstract = {The development of a demonstration fusion power plant (DEMO) is widely considered a crucial step beyond ITER leading toward fusion electricity. In a viable DEMO plant two major functions have to be achieved, namely to breed tritium for fuel self-sufficiency and to extract high-grade heat to allow an efficient electricity production. The breeding blanket is the key component to ensure these two functions. The solid breeder blanket is considered in the design of several ITER Test blankets and DEMO breeding blankets. In Europe, the helium cooled solid breeder blanket, so-called Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) blanket, is one of the two driver blanket candidates selected for the European DEMO. In spite of the considerable progress and achievements, several potential issues inherent to the choice of the neutron multiplier and coolant remain with this concept. To overcome these challenges, research activities on an innovative concept (a Water cooled Lead Ceramic Breeder - WLCB), in which Lead/Lead-alloy is used as neutron multiplier, ceramic pebbles as tritium breeder, pressurized sub-cooled water as coolant, are on-going. This concept avoids the potential safety issue (exothermic hydrogen-producing Be-water reaction or PbLi-water reaction in case of water leakage) when Beryllium/Beryllide is used as neutron multiplier or lithium lead is used tritium breeder in a water cooled blanket concept. The neutronics, thermal hydraulics and mechanical performance figures of the above-mentioned innovative blanket concept are presented. This work concludes with possible future work and outlook towards the development of innovative alternative blanket concepts for the European demonstration fusion power plants.},

The experiments were performed in order to simulate the displacement damage that fusion neutrons will cause in a tungsten plasma-facing component of a future fusion device. To study the influence of the presence of hydrogen isotopes during the creation of displacement damage on the final defect density, tungsten irradiation and deuterium decoration cycles were performed up to three times. Deuterium depth profiling with 3He Nuclear Reaction Analysis and Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy showed that the deuterium concentration increased after each additional tungsten irradiation and deuterium exposure. After the third cycle, the deuterium concentration reached a maximum of 3.6 at.\% at the given plasma exposure temperature of 370 K. We attribute this increase in retention to the stabilization of the displacement damage during the tungsten irradiation by the presence of deuterium. The experimental results were simulated using the MHIMS-R macroscopic rate-equation code, which was recently upgraded with a damage stabilization term to describe experiments where tungsten was irradiated with MeV tungsten ions and simultaneously exposed to low-energy deuterium ions. Using this novel model, it was possible to quantitatively describe also the present results for the sequential irradiation/exposure scheme, with model parameters that were congruent with parameters derived from the simultaneous experiment. Modelling shows that kinetic de-trapping of trapped deuterium takes place during irradiation However, it is not the dominant process that explains defect stabilization. In addition, the model facilitates the extrapolation of present experimental results to an even larger number of sequential tungsten irradiation and deuterium exposure cycles. The model predicts that after about five sequential irradiation and plasma exposure cycles, a stationary state is reached with an associated maximum trapped D concentration of 4.2 at.\% for the given exposure temperature of 370 K.},

	abstract = {Fusion energy is expected as a promising candidate for alternative next generation energy. For fusion reactor, the plasma facing components (PFCs) are the most critical components to achieve this goal. PFCs will suffer severe thermal shock due to repective cyclic high heat flux (HHF) loads. This paper investigates the effects of thermal shock and damage behavior of tungsten armored PFCs under steady, transient and combined thermal loads. The distribution of stress field is analyzed, and crack initiation is predicted using the extended finite element method (XFEM). The unique features of thermal-mechanical behavior of tungsten armored PFCs under simulated service condition are discussed. The dominant factor of the cracking of the tungsten armor is the brittleness of tungsten below ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Under the steady loads, the cracking position is apt to near the interface of tungsten armor and the interlayer, and the threshold of cracking is between 14 MW/m2 and 16 MW/m2. With 6 MW/m2 steady loads, applying 1 ms duration of transient load, the cracking threshold is between 0.2 GW/m2 to 0.4 GW/m2. The depth of cracking increases from 100 um to 500 um with the transient load increasing from 0.4 GW/m2 to 1.0 GW/m2. Researches are useful for the design and structural optimization of tungsten-armored PFCs, and the long-term stable operation of further reactor.},

	abstract = {Reduced activation ferritic-martensitic (RAFM) steels have been developed for decades for use as fusion blanket structural materials, and have advantages in both mechanical properties and irradiation resistance following careful engineering of the microstructure. However, the hydrogen isotope behavior in these proposed fusion structural materials is not well understood, but is important to assess since it impacts the fusion reactor safety and self-sufficient tritium fuel cycle. In this work, we investigated deuterium transport and retention in representative advanced RAFM steels, including castable nanostructured alloys (CNAs), and oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels. A gas-driven permeation (GDP) system was used to measure the permeability, diffusivity and solubility of the studied materials, covering the temperature range from 623 K to 873 K, and the loading pressures from 1.8×104 to 1.0×105 Pa. The results indicated that the deuterium permeability has little material dependence. In contrast, the deuterium diffusivity of the studied materials showed significant variation. The deuterium diffusivity in ODS steels is one order of magnitude lower than that in RAFM steels and CNAs, and correspondingly, have an effective solubility that is 2–10 times larger than RAFM steels and CNAs. In addition, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) measurements were performed to assess the deuterium retention and desorption of these materials following a static thermal deuterium charging at 723 Kfor 1 hour under the deuterium pressure of 1.0×105Pa. It was found that ODS steels exhibit the highest deuterium retention and have broader desorption peaks. Microstructural features contributing to deuterium retention and impacting deuterium transport are discussed to rationalize the observed deuterium behavior in the studied RAFM steels.},

At low temperatures ({\textless}900 K), fuzz does not grow because almost all He is trapped in very small He-vacancy clusters. At high temperatures ({\textgreater}2300 K), all He is detrapped from clusters, preventing the formation of the large clusters that lead to fuzz growth in the intermediate temperature range.},

It proves advantageous to reformulate the last, a mixed boundary value problem, in terms of a linear integral equation.

The aim of this paper is to assess the MHD pressure losses in the TBM frontal part, also called Breeding Zone (BZ). There, important contributions are caused by the manifold interface, the presence of cooling pipes obstructing the fluid movement, a sharp hairpin bend, and non-uniform wall thickness of the walls. Direct numerical simulation of 2D and 3D MHD flows is used to estimate the head loss for each one of these elements. A scaling law is derived to allow quick estimate of the pressure loss from reference parameters. The main contribution to the head loss is caused by the windows that connect the BZ with the manifold.},

	abstract = {Tritium permeation from breeder material to the Water Coolant System (WCS) in Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) Breeding Blanket (BB) is one of the technological issues to be solved in the design of the European DEMO. Since the tritium extraction from the Water Coolant System is more challenging and expensive than the extraction from the eutectic alloy PbLi, it is mandatory to use of a protective coating on the blanket wall to minimize the permeation rate. Moreover, a protective coating can prevent the corrosion of EUROFER steel by the action of PbLi. alumina-based coatings are considered as reference for barriers thanks to their good chemical compatibility with the PbLi alloy and their capability to reduce permeation. Three coating technologies were selected in the frame of the EUROfusion project: electrochemical ECX (chemical deposition) process, Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) coating. The coatings were developed and optimized in order to satisfy the design requirements of good mechanical compatibility with steels, strong adhesion, corrosion compatibility in PbLi at relevant BB design conditions and a Permeation Reduction Factor at least of 200 under neutron irradiation. The present paper aims to describe the status of the technologies and the main results obtained. The final objectives of the R\&D activities are to demonstrate the applicability of the coating to WCLL BB and therefore the scale-up of the technologies from laboratory scale to the BB scale.},

	abstract = {The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor is the product of a conceptual design study aimed at reducing the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a ∼200–250MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3m, a minor radius of 1.1m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Qp≈13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ∼63\%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ∼23T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25MW of lower hybrid and 13.6MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio≥1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

engineering requirements, complicated sector maintenance, and marginal tritium breeding ratios (TBR). We present a conceptual design of a fully liquid blanket. To maximize tritium breeding volume, the vacuum vessel is completely immersed in a continuously recycled FLiBe blanket, with the exception of small support posts. FLiBe has a wide liquid
temperature window (459 C to 1430 C), low electrical conductivity to minimize MHD effects, similar thermal/fluid characteristics to water, and is chemically inert. While tritium breeding with FLiBe in
traditional blankets is poor, we use MCNP neutronics analysis to show that the immersion blanket design coupled with a beryllium neutron multiplier results in TBR {\textgreater} 1. FLiBe is shown to be a sufficient radiation shield for the toroidal field magnets and can be used as a coolant for the vacuum vessel and divertor, allowing for a simplified single-phase, low-pressure, single-fluid cooling scheme. When coupled with a high-field compact reactor design, the immersion blanket
eliminates the need for complex sector maintenance, allows the vacuum vessel to be a replaceable component, and reduces financial cost.},

Tests were conducted in molten FLiBe salt (melting point: 459 °C) at 700 °C in graphite crucibles and 316 stainless steel crucibles for exposure duration of up to 3000 h. Corrosion-induced microstructural changes in the near-surface regions of the samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with EDS capabilities. Intergranular corrosion attack in the near-surface regions was observed with associated Cr depletion along the grain boundaries. High-angle grain boundaries (15–180°) were particularly prone to intergranular attack and Cr depletion. The depth of attack extended to the depths of 22 μm after 3000-h exposure for the samples tested in graphite crucible, while similar exposure in 316 stainless steel crucible led to the attack depths of only about 11 μm. Testing in graphite crucibles led to the formation of nanometer-scale Mo2C, Cr7C3 and Al4C3 particle phases in the near-surface regions of the material. The copious depletion of Cr in the near-surface regions induced a γ-martensite to α-ferrite phase (FeNix) transformation.

The tests were performed at 850°C for 500h in sealed graphite crucibles under an argon cover gas. Corrosion was noted to occur predominantly by dealloying of Cr from the alloys, an effect that was particularly pronounced at the grain boundaries of these alloys. Weight-loss due to corrosion generally correlated with the initial Cr-content of the alloys, and was consistent with the Cr-content measured in the salts after corrosion tests. Two Cr-free alloys, Ni-201 and Nb–1Zr, were also tested. Ni-201, a nearly pure Ni alloy with minor alloying additions, exhibited good resistance to corrosion, whereas Nb–1Zr alloy exhibited extensive corrosion attack. The graphite crucible may have accelerated the corrosion process by promoting the formation of carbide phases on the walls of the test crucibles, but did not alter the basic corrosion mechanism.},

A specially designed beamline and flowing-water corrosion cell added to the 1.7MV tandem accelerator at the Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory provide the capability to study the simultaneous effects of displacement damage and radiolysis on corrosion. A thin sample serves as both a “window” into the corrosion cell through which the proton beam passes completely, and the sample for assessing irradiation accelerated corrosion. The facility was tested by irradiating stainless steel samples at beam current densities between 0.5 and 10μA/cm2 in 130°C and 320°C deaerated water, and 320°C water with 3wppm H2. Increases in the conductivity and dissolved oxygen content of the water varied with the proton beam current, suggesting that proton irradiation was accelerating the corrosion of the sample. Conductivity increases were greatest at 320°C, while DO increases were highest at 130°C. The addition of 3wppm H2 suppressed DO below detectable levels. The facility will enable future studies into the effect of irradiation on corrosion in high temperature water with in situ proton irradiation.},

	abstract = {Using transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) we measure the thermal diffusivity of tungsten exposed to different levels of 20 MeV self-ion irradiation. Damage as low as 3.2 × 10−4 displacements per atom (dpa) causes a measurable reduction in thermal diffusivity. Doses of 0.1 dpa and above, up to 10 dpa, give a degradation of ∼55\% from the pristine value at room temperature. Using a kinetic theory model, the density of irradiation-induced point defects is estimated based on the measured changes in thermal diffusivity as a function of dose. These predictions are compared with point defect and dislocation loop densities observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Molecular dynamics (MD) predictions are combined with the TEM observations to estimate the density of point defects associated with defect clusters too small to be probed by TEM. When these “invisible” defects are accounted for, the total point defect density agrees well with that estimated from TGS for a range of doses spanning 3 orders of magnitude. Kinetic theory modelling is also used to estimate the thermal diffusivity degradation expected due to TEM-visible and invisible defects. Finely distributed invisible defects appear to play a much more important role in the thermal diffusivity reduction than larger TEM-visible dislocation loops. This work demonstrates the capability of TGS, in conjunction with kinetic theory models, to provide rapid, quantitative insight into defect densities and property evolution in irradiated materials.},

	abstract = {One of the main issues in view of the realization of a DEMOnstration fusion reactor is the availability of a sufficient external supply of tritium (T) to start operation. T is an unstable nuclide, which is almost absent in nature and is currently available as by-product in e.g. CANDU, whose operation in the next decades (both in terms of life extension of existing reactors and construction of new ones) is at the moment under debate. During DEMO operation, T will be generated on-site by breeding blanket, employing the neutrons originating from D-T reaction. However, it is considered that a certain initial amount of T is needed to start operation, the so-called start-up inventory. An alternative approach consists of obtaining the start-up inventory exploiting reactions occurring in a D-D plasma, which generate T both directly in the plasma and via breeding in the breeding blanket. In the present paper, the conditions under which D-D start-up becomes a favorable option for a power plant are discussed. The analysis mainly focuses on the EU-DEMO reactor concept, for which design data are sufficient for a fairly quantitative evaluation of the relevant parameters. It is found that the unavoidable presence of elements requiring saturation before they are able to release significant amounts of T clamps the T production rate to the same order of magnitude as D-D reaction rate. Thus, under very optimistic assumptions, several hundreds of full-current D-D discharges are necessary for T to be available for plasma fueling, but more realistic estimates let this number raise up to several thousands.},

	abstract = {In ITER and future tokamaks, high heat flux loads will lead to recrystallization and decrease in toughness and thermal shock resistance of tungsten plasma facing materials, resulting in crack network formation and possible failure. In this study, thermal shock tests of blank, helium-plasma-exposed and helium-ion-irradiated rolled tungsten with/without isothermal annealing are conducted. Without annealing, cracks start to form in blank tungsten at the power density of 0.35 GW/m2, while no cracks are observed on the loaded surface of helium-plasma-exposed and helium-ion-irradiated ones. After annealing at 1473 K for 1 h, the recrystallization fractions of the three kinds of tungsten are around 50\%, 18\% and 8\%, respectively. The following thermal shock tests of the annealed samples show that the cracking thresholds of blank and helium-plasma-exposed ones reduce to 0.3 GW/m2, while cracks do not appear in the helium-ion-irradiated one at this power density. Surface roughening thresholds are also improved in helium pre-implanted samples and do not change after annealing. It indicates that both helium plasma and ion irradiation improve the thermal stability and damaging threshold of tungsten, and helium ion irradiation has a stronger influence. This suggests a potential benefit of helium to extend the service lifetime of tungsten.},

The tritium permeating above the liquid surface is carried by an argon flow to a diagnostic system comprised of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a gas chromatographer and a proportional counter. Tritium permeability in flibe as a function of temperature is determined by the measured permeation flow rates reached in steady-state conditions, while the diffusivity is determined by fitting the transient process with the analytical solution for the diffusion process.

Increasing the irradiation temperature from 750 to 2500 K leads to a significant change in both the radius of He nano-bubbles and He retention. At an elevated temperature, He solute atoms prefer to rapidly diffuse into He nano-bubbles, thus affecting their concentration, growth and surface bursting. The decrease in He retention is attributed to an increase in the hop rate of solute He atoms in the W top layer, resulting in the significant He release from the W surface. The radius and density of He nano-bubbles calculated by our model are consistent with our experimental observation.},

This paper provides a comprehensive report on the state of knowledge of beryllium behaviour under fusion-relevant conditions: the erosion mechanisms and their consequences, beryllium migration in JET, fuel retention and dust generation. The paper reviews basic laboratory studies, advanced computer simulations and experience from laboratory plasma experiments in linear simulators of plasma–wall interactions and in controlled fusion devices using beryllium plasma-facing components.

Our computations reveal that the empty voids are centers of dilatation resulting in the development of tensile stress in the tungsten matrix, whereas He-filled voids (nanobubbles) introduce compressive stress in the plasma-exposed tungsten. We find that the dependence of the elastic moduli of plasma-exposed tungsten, namely, the bulk, Young, and shear modulus, on its void fraction follows a universal exponential scaling relation. We also find that the elastic moduli of plasma-exposed tungsten soften substantially as a function of He content in the tungsten matrix, following an exponential scaling relation; this He-induced exponential softening is in addition to the softening caused in the matrix with increasing temperature. A systematic characterization of the dependence of the elastic moduli on the He bubble size reveals that He bubble growth significantly affects both the bulk modulus and the Poisson ratio of plasma-exposed tungsten, while its effect on the Young and shear moduli of the plasma-exposed material is weak. Our findings contribute directly to the development of a structure–property database that is required for the predictive modeling of the dynamical response of PFCs in nuclear fusion devices.},

	abstract = {Based on a continuous-domain model, capable of accessing the spatiotemporal scales relevant to fuzz formation on the surface of plasma-facing component (PFC) tungsten, we report self-consistent simulation results that elucidate the effects of elastic softening and helium (He) accumulation kinetics on the surface morphological response of PFC tungsten. The model accounts for the softening of the elastic moduli in the near-surface region of PFC tungsten, including both thermal softening at high temperature and softening due to He accumulation upon He implantation. The dependence of the elastic moduli on the He content follows an exponential scaling relation predicted by molecular-dynamics simulations, while the He content in the near-surface region of PFC tungsten evolves according to a first-order saturation kinetics, consistent with experimental and simulation results reported in the literature. We establish that this elastic softening accelerates both nanotendril growth on the PFC surface and the onset of fuzz formation. We also explore the role of the rate of He accumulation to a saturation level in the near-surface region of irradiated tungsten in the onset of fuzz formation. For PFC tungsten surfaces such as W(110) where, under typical irradiation conditions, the characteristic time scale for stress-driven surface diffusion is comparable to the characteristic time scale for He accumulation, we find that accelerating the rate of He accumulation accelerates the growth rate of nanotendrils emanating from the surface. Additionally, we present a systematic parametric study of the PFC surface morphological response to explore its dependence on the He accumulation kinetics that is controlled by the irradiation conditions for low-energy implantation. Finally, we introduce an incubation time for nanotendril growth on the PFC surface, a concept equivalent to that of incubation fluence discussed in the literature, to predict and explain the minimum exposure time required to observe fuzz formation on PFC tungsten surfaces.},

In the present work, three tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}, \{110\} and \{111\} -oriented were studied by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. We find that the tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}-oriented retain fewer helium atoms than the tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{110\} or \{111\}-oriented. Moreover, the microstructural changes of tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}-oriented are smaller than others after high helium fluence exposure, which indicates that the nanochannel tungsten film maybe more suitable than bulk tungsten for plasma facing material in releasing helium atoms and delaying the formation of “fuzz” structure.

Our recent experiments have shown that nanochannel tungsten (W) films have clearly superior radiation tolerance properties. In the present work, helium clustering and release from nanochannel tungsten were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of temperature and vacancy concentration on the helium release from a tungsten cylinder were investigated. Our results show that nanochannel W that consists of thin W cylinders releases He atoms more quickly than bulk W with flat surfaces, thus greatly reducing the He concentration and suppressing the formation and growth of He bubbles, which leads to increased radiation tolerance. Moreover, the microstructural changes due to increasing He fluence are smaller in nanochannel W than those in bulk W. Although vacancies in nanochannel W will trap He atoms, the nanochannel W also has a stronger tendency to stabilize helium retention than bulk W. The mechanism of helium release from nanochannel W was also examined. The results reported here are beneficial for guiding future work in the design of radiation resistant PFMs.},

Samples of oxygen free copper (OFC) were also investigated in the same way. For OFC, annealing at 773 K could reduce D retention appreciably. It indicates the temperature of 773 K is high enough to reduce the total D amount trapped by intrinsic defects (i.e. vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries). However, for CuCrZr alloy, heat treatment does not reduce the D retention significantly until the annealing temperature is higher than 1073 K. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) observations show that the density of precipitate particles especially the Zr-rich precipitate particles increase for the 1073 K-annealed one. It suggests the dissolved Zr atoms in the substrate are responsible for the D retention in CuCrZr alloy. D detrapping energy from the dissolved Zr atoms in CuCrZr alloy is estimated to be 0.98 eV from the TDS measurements.},

A pressure range from 0.3 to 13.3 Pa is explored. Additional insight into what drives the formation of T0 is established through co-deposit formation parameter variations including deposition temperature spanning 373 K to 608 K, and ion impact energy in the range 10-100 eV. It is found that the formation of the sharp release feature exhibits a multi-parameter dependence, but is predominately favored by low deposition temperature, higher D2 pressure, and to a small degree, increased ion impact energy, during deposition. TESSIM simulations of the D2 thermal release at the ITER bake temperatures of Tb1 (513 K) and Tb2 (623 K), show that the best efficacy for D removal (defined as the ratio of post to pre bake inventory) is found when the sharp release feature is present. However, when this feature is present, the total retained D inventory tends to be significantly increased.},

	abstract = {The effect of helium (He) on deuterium (D) retention and transport in the bulk of tungsten (W) was investigated. For this purpose samples were irradiated by 500 keV He ions at 300 K to different fluences in order to obtain He maximum concentrations of 1 at.\%, 3.4 at.\%, and 6.8 at.\% in 0.84 µm depth. In order to discern the effect of irradiation damage caused by He implantation from the effect of the pure He presence on D retention, the W samples were irradiated at 300 K by 20 MeV W ions in advance to create displacement damage in the crystal lattice to a damage dose of 0.23 dpa. The samples were exposed to a D atom beam at 600 K with a flux of 3.5 × 1018 D m−2s−1 to populate all the created defects. The D depth profiles were measured in situ during and at the end of exposure by nuclear reaction analysis to follow the dynamics of the D uptake. Thermal desorption spectra were collected ex situ at the end of the exposure. We show that D retention increases with implanted He fluence linearly following a D/He ratio of 0.29. We obtained peaking of D concentration at the position of maximum He concentration, reaching for the 6.8 at.\% He sample three times higher D concentration (1.1 at.\%) than obtained on high dpa W ion irradiated samples (0.37 at.\%) for the same loading conditions. D retention and transport was also studied on He-containing samples that were annealed to 1700 K. There was no reduction of D retention in the He zone but 80\% reduction in the only W irradiated zone was observed, meaning displacement damage was almost completely removed. In the He zone the D concentration increased to 1.35 at.\%, and we attribute this to trapping of D around He bubbles of 1.5 nm size created at the He peak maximum as obtained by transmission electron microscopy. Neither in the as He implanted nor the 1700 K annealed sample did He act as diffusion barrier. From this study we can conclude that in the main wall of a future fusion device the effect of He will not dominate D retention in W, but at high heat flux areas where displacement damage possibly anneals out He could accumulate in the material and it could eventually dominate over the effect of displacement damage.},

Special attention is paid on the radiological hazard, which until now has been translated in the reduction of materials activation. Indeed, one of ARC main goals is to be fast deployable in any US site: thus, the radiological risk associated to its presence must be minimized, both for the population and the environment. Tritium is one of the main sources of radiological hazard in ARC and it is almost ubiquitous: it is found in the vacuum chamber, in the blanket, in structural materials and in tritium processing and storing components. In this work, a safety analysis is proposed to quantify the radioactivity release following an accidental scenario. Tritium inventories in the main components are estimated starting from the preliminary design of the FLiBe circuit. The source term is quantified assuming the occurrence of a severe accident damaging key components. Afterward, the environmental impact and the doses to the most exposed individuals are evaluated through suitable population doses codes, and ARC compliance with safety limits is assessed.},

The bubbles are small enough that their loop-punching pressures cannot be accurately predicted with continuum mechanics, and their expansion behavior is important, as it appears to cause many of the features observed on helium-irradiated tungsten surfaces.

While certain effects, such as radiolysis and irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking, are reasonably well established, the basic science of how irradiation-induced defects in the base material and the corrosion layer influence the corrosion process still presents many unanswered questions. In this review, we summarize the work that has been done to understand these coupled extremes, highlight the complex nature of this problem, and identify key knowledge gaps. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Materials Science, Volume 51 is August 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.},

	abstract = {The effect of neutron-irradiation damage has been mainly simulated using high-energy ion bombardment. A recent MIT report (PSFC/RR-10-4, An assessment of the current data affecting tritium retention and its use to project towards T retention in ITER, Lipschultz et al., 2010) summarizes the observations from high-energy ion bombardment studies and illustrates the saturation trend in deuterium concentration due to damage from ion irradiation in tungsten and molybdenum above 1 displacement per atom (dpa). While this prior database of results is quite valuable for understanding the behavior of hydrogen isotopes in plasma facing components (PFCs), it does not encompass the full range of effects that must be considered in a practical fusion environment due to short penetration depth, damage gradient, high damage rate, and high primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy spectrum of the ion bombardment. In addition, neutrons change the elemental composition via transmutations, and create a high radiation environment inside PFCs, which influences the behavior of hydrogen isotope in PFCs, suggesting the utilization of fission reactors is necessary for neutron-irradiation. Under the framework of the US–Japan TITAN program, tungsten samples (99.99at.\% purity from A.L.M.T. Co.) were irradiated by fission neutrons in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), at 50 and 300°C to 0.025, 0.3, and 2.4dpa, and the investigation of deuterium retention in neutron-irradiated tungsten was performed in the Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE), the unique high-flux linear plasma facility that can handle tritium, beryllium and activated materials. This paper reports the recent results from the comparison of ion-damaged tungsten via various ion species (2.8MeV Fe2+, 20MeV W2+, and 700keV H−) with that from neutron-irradiated tungsten to identify the similarities and differences among them.},

	abstract = {The commonly accepted picture for the uptake of hydrogen isotopes (HIs) from the gas phase across the surface into a metal with an endothermic heat of solution for HIs is that of dissociation followed by thermalisation in a chemisorbed surface state and finally overcoming a surface barrier to enter the metal bulk where the HIs occupy interstitial solute sites. To leave the metal bulk the HIs first transition to the chemisorbed surface state from which they then enter gas phase by recombining into a diatomic molecule. This model is generally attributed to the work of Pick and Sonnenberg from 1985. They clearly distinguish surface states and subsurface solute sites where the recombination flux is proportional to the square of the concentration of chemisorbed atoms due the diatomic nature of this Langmuir–Hinshelwood process. In an effort to compare their extended model with an earlier surface model by Waelbroeck, which uses an expression for the recombination flux proportional to the square of the sub-surface interstitial solute concentration, they derive an effective recombination coefficient. However, also with the so-derived Pick and Sonnenberg recombination coefficient, the Waelbroeck model is only applicable under certain conditions. But, due to its simplicity, it is often used in boundary conditions of diffusion trapping type calculations, generally ignoring whether or not these conditions are met. This paper will use the full Pick and Sonnenberg model implemented in the TESSIM-X code and in simplified algebraic approximations, to show the limits of applicability of the Waelbroeck-Ansatz in modelling hydrogen transport in metals foreseen for the first wall of magnetic confinement fusion devices.},

Our recent studies revealed that the ion irradiation of helium at room temperature produces 〈111〉-oriented surface grains in single-crystalline tungsten 100 and 110, which may play an important role in the surface and subsurface evolutions of tungsten subjected to fusion-relevant service environments. Although the driving force for the formation of surface grains is well explained by ion channeling effect, the underlying formation mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we investigated the orientation relationship between irradiation-induced new surface grains and single-crystalline tungsten matrix. The experimental results of electron backscatter diffraction demonstrated that the formation of most 〈111〉-oriented surface grains in both helium-irradiated tungsten 100 or 110 can be regarded as the grain rotation of matrix around its in-plane 〈110〉 axis.},

The model describes the sticking of hydrogen isotopes from the gas phase to W surfaces and the desorption from W surfaces. The initial sticking coefficient is set to one and independent of the temperature. The activation energy for desorption depends on the hydrogen coverage of the surface and is parametrised with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for W(100), W(110), and W(111) surface. The DFT-parametrised model is successfully compared to experimental results showing that the amount of measured tritium as well as the desorption kinetic can be modelled with only tritium adsorbed on the surface of W dust particles. Then, the model is used to explore possible scenarios to remove the tritium from the W surfaces by exposing the tritiated surfaces to either deuterium and hydrogen. The simulations suggest that it can be possible to remove all the tritium trapped on the W surfaces even at room temperature as soos as the hydrogen or deuterium pressure is higher than the tritium pressure. This gives opportunity to build tritium removal scenarios for ITER.},

The feasibility of such plasma-induced removal as a potential means of tritium control has been investigated. Be-D co-deposited layers with a thickness of around 3 μm were created at 428–458 K and exposed to D or H plasma at various temperatures (673–873 K) for various times (180–1200 s). The remaining D content was measured by thermal desorption spectroscopy and compared to the control samples. Plasma-induced desorption was found to be efficient in removing significant amounts of D out of the co-deposits, removing 85\% of D from the layer after D plasma exposure at 773 K for 1200 s and 84\% of D after exposure at 873 K for only 180 s.},

	abstract = {Owing to its high magnetic field, high power, and compact size, the SPARC experiment will operate with divertor conditions at or above those expected in reactor-class tokamaks. Power exhaust at this scale remains one of the key challenges for practical fusion energy. Based on empirical scalings, the peak unmitigated divertor parallel heat flux is projected to be greater than 10 GW m−2. This is nearly an order of magnitude higher than has been demonstrated to date. Furthermore, the divertor parallel Edge-Localized Mode (ELM) energy fluence projections ({\textasciitilde}11–34 MJ m−2) are comparable with those for ITER. However, the relatively short pulse length ({\textasciitilde}25 s pulse, with a {\textasciitilde}10 s flat top) provides the opportunity to consider mitigation schemes unsuited to long-pulse devices including ITER and reactors. The baseline scenario for SPARC employs a {\textasciitilde}1 Hz strike point sweep to spread the heat flux over a large divertor target surface area to keep tile surface temperatures within tolerable levels without the use of active divertor cooling systems. In addition, SPARC operation presents a unique opportunity to study divertor heat exhaust mitigation at reactor-level plasma densities and power fluxes. Not only will SPARC test the limits of current experimental scalings and serve for benchmarking theoretical models in reactor regimes, it is also being designed to enable the assessment of long-legged and X-point target advanced divertor magnetic configurations. Experimental results from SPARC will be crucial to reducing risk for a fusion pilot plant divertor design.},

These components are integrated to predict changes in surface morphology and fuel recycling, and the effect of material erosion and re-deposition in fuel retention. Integrated simulations for ITER-like parameters in a helium plasma environment are presented, focused on the response of the tungsten divertor. The model is also applied to predicting the response of the tungsten surface pre-damaged by He plasma, to burning plasma operations. This case further demonstrates the capability to model the effect of sub-surface helium dynamics, which include helium nucleation, clustering and the bursting of over-pressurized bubbles, its impact on fuel recycling as well as the effect of sputtering on the surface evolution.},

Neon (Ne) seeded discharges for divertor power dissipation are considered. The results for divertor and scrape-off layer (SOL) parameters with and without drifts are compared, both for the SOLPS-ITER simulations and against the earlier SOLPS-4.3 modelling (which did not include a drift description) constituting the bulk of the existing ITER divertor simulation database. Whereas the drift effect on the equatorial midplane (main chamber) density and temperature profiles is moderate, drifts increase the peak heat flow to the outer divertor target. This effect is more pronounced for regimes with low sub-divertor neutral pressure, when even drift-free SOLPS4.3 simulations find strong out-in target power asymmetries. An important conclusion is thus that if ITER operates as expected with partially detached divertor targets, drifts should not influence the power handling, but that in the case of divertor reattachment, they will act to worsen the target loading, increasing the need for development of reliable schemes for detachment control. Comparing SOLPS-4.3 and SOLPS-ITER results for the key peak target heat flux versus sub-divertor neutral pressure operating domain, SOLPS-ITER with drifts predicts a narrower operational window for the divertor pressure.},

	abstract = {During the ITER design phase, the focus of ITER boundary plasma modeling activities has been on divertor performance under baseline H-mode, fusion power operation (FPO) conditions. However, early ITER operation will be primarily with hydrogen fuel in L-mode, in the pre-fusion power operation 1 (PFPO-1) phase. Here, the SOLPS-ITER code is used to evaluate divertor performance during this non-active phase. To verify the assumptions used in the existing high power simulation database, gas throughput scans were performed for two types of divertor surface material (beryllium and tungsten) and two gas puff locations (divertor and main chamber). The adoption of beryllium target surfaces simulates the effect of main chamber material erosion and migration and, along with main chamber gas injection, is the current default for the high power database. Depending on the divertor surface material, the atom to molecule ratio of the recycled neutral particles varies. This modifies the momentum and power loss mechanisms arising from plasma–neutral interactions. However, since the effect of atomic and molecular reactions are compensatory, the ‘total’ power and momentum losses are relatively insensitive to the target surface material. Similarly, the impact of gas puff location on divertor plasma parameters is not significant, though main chamber injection provides an additional ionization source in the upstream scrape-off layer (SOL) and leads to moderate changes in the upstream density and far SOL parameters. However, these effects can be neglected within the available range of the gas puff and pump rates in ITER. Since beryllium and tungsten are materials at both extremes in terms of surface reflection properties, the conclusions may be applicable to other divertor surface materials. An important additional finding of the study is that the insensitivity of upstream density to divertor neutral pressure found in the FPO database is also recovered in these PFPO-1 simulations.},

	abstract = {Harnessing modern parallel computing resources to achieve complex multiphysics simulations is a daunting task. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) aims to enable such development by providing simplified interfaces for specification of partial differential equations, boundary conditions, material properties, and all aspects of a simulation without the need to consider the parallel, adaptive, nonlinear, finite element solve that is handled internally. Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales. Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language.

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {In PbLi based breeding blanket concepts, tritium is produced inside the liquid metal and drag out of the reactor by the liquid metal flow. However, undesired permeation through the channels and pipes walls occurs spontaneously since tritium naturally diffuses in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient. This way tritium can reach the blanket coolant circuit or even the exterior with an impact on the tritium self-sustainability and the safety of the plant. Similarly to heat transfer processes, permeation through the walls in the interface between the flow and the steel is mostly affected by the dynamics of the boundary layers. This is ruled by the electrical coupling between the moving conductor and the conducting walls as a result of the Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) interactions which dominate the flow dynamics. In this work, the connection between the MHD forces and tritium transport is numerically studied using the simulation platform ANSYS-Fluent. The velocity profiles of a PbLi test channel have been firstly computed in a wide range of Hartmann numbers from 102 to 104. These velocity profiles are then applied to a 3D tritium transport model developed with the customization capabilities of the same platform. A series of tritium transport simulations are carried out considering different permeation regimes: surface-limited, diffusion-limited and intermediate regimes. The development of the concentration boundary layers along the channel is studied in different permeation regimes, magnetic fields and velocity fields. This has allowed correlating the Sherwood number (Sh) with the Hartmann (Ha), Reynolds (Re) and permeation numbers (W).},

Future tokamaks, nevertheless, may likely use alternative confinement modes such as high or advanced confinement modes (H\&A-mode). Based on analytical formulae used in plasma physics, H\&A-modes D-T neutron sources formulae are proposed in this paper. For that purpose, a tokamak random neutron source generator, TRANSGEN, has been built generating bidimensional (radial and poloidal) neutron source maps to be used as input for neutronics Monte-Carlo codes (TRIPOLI-4 and MCNP5). The impact of such a source on the neutronic behavior of the European DEMO-2007 Helium-cooled lithium–lead reactor concept has been assessed and compared with previous results obtained using a L-mode neutron source. An A-mode neutron source map from TRANSGEN has been used with the code TRIPOLI-4. Assuming the same fusion power, results show that main reactor global neutronic parameters, e.g. tritium breeding ratio and neutron multiplication factor, evolved slightly when compared to present uncertainties margin. However, local parameters, such as the neutron wall loading (NWL), change significantly compared to L-mode shape: from −22\% to +11\% for NWL.},

	abstract = {Fusion reactor environments inevitably lead to the formation of high-pressure helium bubbles whose nucleation, growth, and diffusion strongly impact the performance of plasma-facing components. This research describes a diffusion mechanism of over-pressurized bubbles via a sequence of Frenkel pair nucleation, self-interstitial migration, and Frenkel pair annihilation. Molecular dynamics was used to simulate the diffusion of small bubbles in tungsten at 2000 K with helium-per-vacancy ratios in the range of 4.5 to 7. The diffusion coefficients are calculated and their dependence on helium content, number of vacancies, and number of attached self-interstitials is characterized. It is found that bubbles are most mobile when the nucleation/annihilation rates of Frenkel pairs are nearly equal and when the bubbles nucleate and annihilate a single self-interstitial. All bubbles experience a peak diffusivity, which can be as high as 10−11 m2/s decreasing with bubble size. The calculated diffusion coefficients provide valuable insight into the mobility of small, high-pressure bubbles, and can be used as input parameters in mesoscale models to improve predictions of plasma-surface interactions.

	abstract = {In this work, the deuterium (D) retention in plasma facing components of the divertor of ITER is estimated. Three scenarios are simulated with 3 different surface temperatures, 1456 K, 870 K and 435 K. They represent the exposure of different parts of the divertor during an attached plasma. Our 1D rate equation model MHIMS (migration of hydrogen isotopes in materials) is used to model the retention in the super-saturated layer formed in the first 10 nm: the D retention integrated in this 10-nm layer is 1e19 Dm-2 for the coldest scenarios. It is also used to differentiate the evolution of deuterium retention during pulsed and continuous plasma exposure which shows that: (i) there is a retention during the ramp-down in the first 10 µm which is released during the ramp-up and (ii) the bulk retention is not affected by the cycling of plasma exposure. The concentration of mobile deuterium in the implantation zone is used as an input of our finite element code FESTIM which is used to assess the deuterium retention and migration in the 2D complex geometry of the actively cooled plasma facing components. In the end, this work enable to determine the three following macroscopic quantities: the total deuterium retention, the permeation flux to the cooling pipe and the desorption flux from the toroidal edges of the components. It is shown that (i) the coldest scenario leads to the highest retention despite the lowest exposure flux which has already been observed in past retention studies, (ii) the permeation to the cooling pipes happens after few thousands of seconds only for the hottest scenario, (iii) the release of deuterium from the toroidal edges is a small fuel recycling source.},

	abstract = {Divertor design and choice of plasma-facing materials (PFM) will be essential to the success of next-generation fusion reactors as they operate under more powerful scenarios. Understanding and controlling interactions between the plasma and PFM is essential to making these choices. Within these plasma–material interactions and especially in tungsten (W), the interplay between the most abundant plasma species (hydrogen isotopes and helium, He) with the wall material alters fuel retention. However, this interplay is yet to be sufficiently understood to confidently project fuel retention levels to future fusion devices. The paper presents a series of integrated simulations of fusion plasmas and their interaction with tungsten. Specifically, this study assesses the impact of He plasma pre-exposure on hydrogenic species retention during 100 s of burning plasma operations (BPO) in ITER. Multiple pre-exposure scenarios are considered, including sub-surface damage resulting from exposures in the linear device PISCES and from early ITER He-operation. The predictions from these consecutive He-BPO exposures show that fuel content and spatial distribution in the material are largely determined by the He-induced damage, as manifest in: (i) changes in surface temperature expected during BPO have little effect on fuel retention in the presence of He-induced damage; (ii) gas content stabilizes quickly in substrates pre-exposed in PISCES, at levels set by the concentration of pre-existing vacancies, while it continues to increase in substrates initially pristine or pre-exposed to ITER He plasmas; (iii) the presence of He and He–V clusters in the near-surface region locally increases hydrogenic retention, but decreases its permeation; this results in hydrogenic species that remain closer to the surface in pre-damaged substrates, while the bulk content is higher for initially pristine cases. In summary, the interaction and binding of D and T with the pre-existing He–V clusters modifies retention and permeation of hydrogen species during ITER BPO.},

	abstract = {Tritium self-sufficiency presents a critical engineering challenge for DEMO, requiring efficient breeding and extraction systems, as well as minimizing tritium losses to the surrounding systems, such as plasma-facing components, vacuum vessel, cooling system, etc. Structural and plasma-facing components will act as a tritium sink, as tritium will be accumulated in the bulk of these components due to energetic particle bombardment and may permeate out of the vacuum system. The design of the plasma-facing components will consequently directly influence the plant lifetime, operational safety and cost of any future power plant. Therefore, modeling of tritium retention and permeation in these components is required for the engineering designs of the tritium breeding and safety systems. In this work, the diffusion-transport code TESSIM-X is benchmarked against the well-established TMAP7 code and a comparison with a simplified DEMO-relevant test case is performed. The use of either code for modeling of DEMO conditions is discussed. Following this, TESSIM-X is used to provide a preliminary assessment of tritium permeation and retention in the DEMO first wall, based on the current WCLL (Water Cooled Lithium Lead) and HCPB (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) breeding blanket designs.},

The investigations showed that the divertor strike line areas on the divertor targets appeared to be the major source of carbon impurities. After multistep erosion and deposition events, carbon was found to be deposited largely at the first wall components, with thick deposits of {\textgreater}1 μm on some baffle tiles, moderate deposits on toroidal closure tiles and thin deposits at the heat shield tiles and the outer wall panels. Some amount of the eroded carbon was pumped out via the vacuum pumps as volatile hydrocarbons and carbon oxides (CO, CO2) formed due to the chemical processes. Boron was introduced by three boronizations and one boron powder injection experiment. Thin boron-dominated layers were found on the inner heat shield and the outer wall panels, some boron was also found at the test divertor unit and in redeposited layers together with carbon. Local erosion/deposition and global migration processes were studied using field-line transport simulations, analytical estimations, 3D-WallDYN and ERO2.0 modeling in standard magnetic field configuration.},

Tritium inventories and permeation fluxes have been computed and the influence of trapping effects in solid domains was highlighted. It was evaluated that inclusion of trapping mechanisms increases inventory values by 15\% and delays permeation to the cooling channels. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of the uncertainty in the literature (2 orders of magnitude) regarding hydrogen solubility in LiPb on these quantities. Varying the lithium lead solubility over the range found in the literature was found to vary the EUROFER inventory by a factor of 25. Permeation fluxes to the coolant channels was found to vary over a factor of 3.},

	abstract = {The influence of the input power (IP), puffing rate and neutral pressure on the fuel (hydrogen isotopes) inventory of the WEST and ITER divertors is investigated. For the chosen range of parameters (relatively low temperature at the strike points), the inventory of the WEST divertor evolves as the power 0.2 of the puffing rate and as the power 0.3 of the IP. The inventory at the strike points is highly dominated by ions whereas it is dominated by neutrals in the private zone. Increasing the fuelling rate increases the retention in the private zone and decreases slightly the retention at the strike points. Increasing the IP increases the inventory at the strike points and does not affect much the inventory at the private flux region. The inventory of the ITER divertor is not strongly dependent on the divertor neutral pressure. The inventory increases from 0 Pa to 7 Pa and then decreases slightly from 7 Pa to 10 Pa. After 107 s of continuous exposure, the maximum inventory in the ITER divertor was found to be 14 g. The inventory is not maximum at the strike points due to the high surface temperature of the monoblocks in this region. The maximum accumulation of H in the ITER divertor is below 5 mg per 400 s discharge and below 2 mg per 400 s discharge after 200 discharges.},

	abstract = {We studied the influence of thin, electro-chemically grown tungsten (W) surface oxide films on hydrogen isotope release from W. As deuterium (D) reservoir underneath the oxide, we used a defect-rich, ion-irradiated W layer that was filled with D prior to oxidation. Several oxide films with thicknesses between 5 and 100nm were studied and compared with tungsten with a natural oxide film. The release of D through the oxide film was analyzed with thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The depth-resolved concentration profiles of D in the sample were measured with nuclear reaction analysis at all experimental steps. Changes of the morphology of the oxide film due to the release of D were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In TDS studies, we found that the thin oxide films significantly influence the release behavior of D from W. The first D release peak (at 560K) is shifted towards higher temperature (or later times) with increasing oxide thickness. This indicates that the oxide film acts as both a D reservoir and a transport barrier that delays D release at temperatures above 475K. At this temperature, D also starts to interact chemically with the oxide film and is released not only as HD or D2 but also in the form of heavy water (HDO and D2O). Above 700K, D is released only in form of heavy water as long as enough oxide is available. Accordingly, SEM images after TDS show a strong modification of the oxide film. For film thicknesses of 5-10nm, all oxide is removed from the surface and smooth metallic W remains. For 15nm, the surface is still partially covered by oxide islands with several micrometer of metallic W between them. From the fact that D is still only released as heavy water at high temperatures, we conclude that the mobility of D atoms at the surface is very high. Even D atoms that surface far from an oxide island apparently travel along the surface to form an O-D group at the W oxide before they recombine with another D atom to form water. Our results indicate that the oxide film becomes relevant for the D release during TDS if the ratio of O atoms on the surface to D atoms in the sample is larger than 5-10 \%. Consequently, even the natural oxide film (1-2nm) that forms on W upon contact with air may significantly influence the D release spectra from TDS for experiments with low D retention.},

There are three important neutronics considerations for the operation of the ARC reactor: (1) breeding of enough tritium in the blanket to sustain the D-T reaction in the plasma; (2) ensuring low fluence on the superconducting toroidal field coils; and (3) assessing neutron volumetric heating in structural components. This work aims to perform a validation of the neutronics analysis approach by code-to-code comparison. State-of-the-art software stacks are employed for the neutronics analysis of the ARC reactor, and a computer-aided design (CAD) model is used directly for Monte Carlo (MC) neutron transport calculations. Three software stacks, Attila-MCNP, OpenMC-DAGMC, and Shift-DAGMC, are used to perform neutronic analysesof a 90°sector CAD model of the ARC reactor. Results show that the flux tallies calculated by the three software stacks are very close. Also, the volumetric heatingand tritium breeding values have less than 0.6\% relative difference between codes.},

In this study, the diffusion behaviors of hydrogen isotopes in Incoloy 800H were investigated with first-principle calculations. Numerical results reveal that the starting and ending positions of the diffusion process are the two adjacent and most stable octahedral sites surrounded by Fe atoms and Ni atoms, and the diffusion follows an indirect path via the metastable tetrahedral sites and octahedral sites surrounded by Fe atoms and Cr atoms. The diffusion activation energies of hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), and tritium (T) in Incoloy 800H are investigated by first-principles calculations with the same approximate value of

Most of the materials used in fusion reactors are metals that have a relatively high permeability for tritium.

Unfortunately, most barrier materials work very well during laboratory experiments, but fail to meet requirements when placed in radiation environments. This chapter presents tritium permeation characteristics of various materials used in fusion reactors, including plasma-facing, structural, and barrier materials. The parameters necessary for tritium release calculations for various regions of a fusion reactor are given.},

	abstract = {The role grain boundaries play in the diffusion of hydrogen in polycrystalline alloys has long been debated. Some researchers have found that grain boundaries have an accelerating effect on the transport of hydrogen across a metal membrane, while others have stated this network of sites may slow the diffusion of hydrogen or have a mixed effect depending on grain size and orientation. Thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS) was used to study the diffusion of deuterium, from 294 K to 550 K, in model single crystal and polycrystalline nickel base alloy, alloy 600, having a grain size of several tens of micrometers. Using a numerical routine, solving Fick's second law of diffusion, TDS spectra were fit or simulated. The derived diffusion constant parameters (D0 = (1.0 ± 0.5)·10−2 cm2 s−1 and ED = (45 ± 4) kJ mol−1) for the polycrystalline alloy adequately predict and simulate the deuterium desorption from the single crystal during TDS testing. Furthermore, in the temperature range and for the grain size studied no significant effect of grain boundaries on the diffusion of deuterium in alloy 600 was observed. Consequently, the measured diffusion parameters are representative of interstitial diffusion in the alloy.},

A complete set of permeability, diffusivity, and Sieverts’ constant for hydrogen and deuterium in Hastelloy N alloy was successfully obtained. The isotope effect in the diffusion process was analyzed and compared with references. The ratios of diffusive transport parameters for hydrogen and deuterium were a permeability ratio of ФH/ФD = 1.32exp(0.34kJ/RT), a diffusivity ratio of DH/DD = 1.15exp(−0.41kJ/RT), and a Sieverts’ constant ratio of KS,H/KS,D = 1.16exp(0.21kJ/RT). The result that the permeation flux of deuterium was decreased after introducing hydrogen could be used to suppress the permeation of tritium in future tritium control of the Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR). Compared with NiO, the Cr2O3 formed in the surface oxidation layer of Hastelloy N alloy showed better hydrogen permeation barrier performance after baking above 700°C in air.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on an enhanced hydrogen permeation effect along grain boundaries in tungsten. Sputtered nanocolumnar tungsten layers (column lateral dimensions 100–150 nm and layer thickness 2 μm) were analysed by hydrogen permeation measurements in the temperature range 520–705 K. The experiments constitute a direct observation of this effect, previously postulated by means of a combination of indirect experiments and simulations and considered controversial due to the lack of direct measurements. DFT results support this observation since (i) the hydrogen binding energy to the grain boundary is 1.05 eV and (ii) the migration energies along the grain boundary and along the bulk are 0.12 eV and 0.20 eV, respectively. OKMC simulations, parametrized by DFT data, were used as a supporting tool to attain a better understanding of the involved phenomena. The OKMC results are also compatible with the observations. Indeed, they show that the fraction of hydrogen flux along grain boundaries in the steady-state permeation regime increases when decreasing the ratio of lateral dimensions to length of the nanocolumns, rapidly approaching unity when this ratio is {\textless} 2. Therefore, grain boundaries act as preferential migration pathways for H atoms at the studied temperature range in the studied samples. This behaviour has interesting implications to reduce the retention of hydrogen in several applications, in particular, fusion materials exposed to plasma discharges.},

	abstract = {Type I Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) occur naturally in H-mode plasmas, the operational regime envisaged for ITER, and lead to high temporal heat load peaks on plasma-facing components that might induce surface melting and deteriorated material properties due to recrystallization. ELM mitigation techniques are being developed that either attempt to fully suppress the ELM, e.g. using resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP), or to trigger the ELM at higher frequencies, intending to reduce its energy content and hence the heat load peak. In this paper, the effect of the increased ELM frequency achieved by ELM mitigation techniques on the ITER tungsten divertor monoblock thermal and recrystallization behavior is numerically analyzed by solving the unsteady heat conduction equation when repeatedly exposing the monoblock to ELM-like heat loads under ITER baseline burning plasma operating conditions. The impinging heat load is based on a set of empirical relations readily found in literature and the recrystallization fraction is computed using an empirical data fit which is based on the non-isothermal JMAK equation as function of temperature and time. Uncertainties such as the statistical spread on empirical relations and the unknown inter-ELM heat load, as well as the effect of the ELM frequency, are quantified by a parameter scan. Adopting the recently developed concept of a ‘recrystallization budget’ to determine the allowed monoblock heat loads [G. De Temmerman et al., PPCF 60 (2018) 0044018], it was found that ELM frequencies between 25 – 50 Hz are allowed for inter-ELM heat loads between 9 – 6 MW m−2 , respectively, when assuming that the scaling for the peak ELM target energy density in [T. Eich et al., NME 12 (2017) 84-90] holds. This provides a new limit for ELM mitigation strategies in ITER.},

One promising fusion machine under design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is ARC reactor. It is likely that the first nuclear fusion plants will rely on a traditional thermodynamic cycle for the downstream power energy conversion. In this framework, one of the design aspects is to maximize the thermal efficiency. In the present paper the thermodynamic cycles, which could be adopted in ARC rector, are explored. Three cycles have been considered: the Rankine, the Brayton and a combined cycle. For the gas adopted in the Brayton and combined cycles, two options have been investigated: supercritical Helium and supercritical CO2. A comparison among thermal efficiency and preliminary considerations on component integrity’s, plant feasibility and economics of each studied configurations has been discussed to identify the possible best option for ARC reactor. The results show that a regenerative CO2 Brayton cycle with intercooler and re-heating systems is the most promising one. Such configurations is able to reach a thermodynamic efficiency of up to 0.6.},

	abstract = {The recent development of REBCO superconducting tapes, cabling methods and joint concepts could be a revolutionary development for magnetic fusion. REBCO has significantly better performance at high magnetic fields than traditional low temperature superconductors (LTS), and can be operated at a higher temperature than LTS for reduced thermodynamic cost of cooling. Use of REBCO superconductors in the magnet systems of tokamaks allows building demountable toroidal field (TF) coils, greatly simplifying reactor construction and maintenance. A demountable TF coil system with REBCO superconductors for a fusion reactor has been conceptually designed. The coil system operates at 20 K, with a maximum magnetic field of 20 T. The magnets are divided into two coil segments and can be detached and remounted to allow the internal components of the reactor to be removed vertically as one piece. Operating at 20 T and 20 K, the stress in most of the coils is acceptable (less than 2/3 the yield strength and less than 1/2 the ultimate tensile strength of the structural materials). The strain in the superconductors is lower than the reversible degradation limit. The electrical resistance in each conductor joint is 10 n [Omega]. The total heat generation in the reactor superconducting TF magnets is approximately 1.9 MW, of which about 25 \% is nuclear heating and 75 \% joint heating. 71 MW of electricity are required for cooling the coils at 20 K, about 7 \% of the electric energy the reactor generates. The expected time to warm-up the magnets from the operation temperature to room temperature is 7 days, and approximately the same for cool-down back to the operation temperature. The analysis of the conceptual magnet design is encouraging, as no insuperable problems have been identified. This conceptual design can be used as a starting point for a full engineering design of demountable fusion reactors magnets.},

A program for developing the TMSR system has been launched in Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In the TMSR system, mixtures of LiF and BeF2, termed FLiBe, are proposed and used as the primary coolant salt, in which tritium is produced mainly by the neutron reactions of lithium. In the TMSR system, at high temperatures, tritium can permeate through metal walls to the surroundings, leading to a potential radiological hazard. Thus, tritium control becomes a major problem hindering the development of the TMSR system. Evaluation of the tritium distribution is necessary for tritium control in the TMSR system. In this study, the Tritium Transport Analysis Code (TTAC) has been developed for simulating the tritium behaviors in the TMSR system (hence, the code TMSR-TTAC), such as tritium chemical forms in coolant salts, tritium transport behaviors, and tritium distribution in the system. The model code is developed by the MATLAB/SIMULINK package, and it is based on the mass balance equations of the tritium-containing species and hydrogen. TMSR-TTAC is benchmarked with the molten salt reactor model, which is based on Molten Salt Reactor Experiment designs. The results show that TMSR-TTAC has the ability to calculate the tritium distribution in the TMSR system.},

In this study, after making the molten salts in an electric furnace and purifying the salts by HF, experiments were performed to determine the behavior of H2 permeation through the fluoride molten salts at static conditions in the range of 500-600 °C using an apparatus composed of tertiary cylindrical Monel400 tubes. In addition, transient H2 diffusion equations in molten salts were solved, and results were compared with experimental effluent H2 concentration curves. It is proved experimentally that the H2 permeability through Flibe or Flinak has linear pressure dependence, and permeability, diffusivity and solubility of H2 in the fluoride molten salts are correlated to their respective Arrhenius-type equations.},

The MELCOR-TMAP for fusion computer code is being developed by INL’s Fusion Safety Program (FSP) by modifying the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC’s) MELCOR computer code for fission reactor severe accident analyses. Recently the INL FSP completed the process of merging INL’s Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP) with MELCOR to provide the US fusion community with a more comprehensive tool for analyzing accidents in future fusion reactors. However, prior to the present modifications, a MELCOR-TMAP user could only substitute one of a number of available fusion coolants for MELCOR’s default coolant of water. This new capability corrects this modeling gap needed for safety assessments of fusion reactors that contain more than a single coolant. In this article, we discuss the present code modifications, benchmark MELCOR-TMAP against predictions from previous versions of the MELCOR code, illustrate the application of the code to analysis of an accident in a multiple fluids reactor concept, and describe future plans for the MELCOR-TMAP code.},

	abstract = {Tritium is produced from neutron interactions with both lithium and beryllium. Large quantities of tritium are generated in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) which use LiF/BeF2 (FLiBe) as the fuel salt. Tritium is unique among the radionuclide hazards as it readily permeates through metal structural materials at high temperatures. All metal surfaces are potential release paths for tritium. For adequate safety analysis and eventual licensing of new reactors, predictive models for tritium transport and release from MSRs must be developed. These models must account for the multiple transport phenomena involved with tritium: fuel salt phase mass transport, dissociation/recombination reactions on metal surfaces, interstitial diffusion through the metal structure, and salt or gas phase mass transport in the downstream fluid. These models also must also be validated with representative experiments. Our previous report outlined tritium transport phenomena involved in MSRs, made suggestions on gaps in the transport dataset, and proposed an experimental test stand to test combined transport effects – tritium transport through pipe walls in a convective salt flow. In this report, we summarize an updated analysis framework for tritium transport in MSRs, report our results on hydrogen and deuterium permeation through Hastelloy N, and describe the final design of the Molten Salt Tritium Transport Experiment (MSTTE, pronounced “misty”). The MSRE provides the only wholistic experimental data set for tritium transport in MSRs and understanding the transport phenomena involved in the MSRE is crucial for future model development. One set of parameters in our analysis framework was unknown for the MSRE—surface reaction rates for tritium on Hastelloy N. This warranted our hydrogen and deuterium permeation campaign to assess the permeability, diffusivity, and solubility of hydrogen isotopes in clean Hastelloy N. Surface reaction rate constants were probed by low pressure measurements, however, no surface effects were observed in the limits of our permeation apparatus. Permeation experiments on oxidized Hastelloy N were not performed for this report but are planned in future work. The experimental test stand, MSTTE, measures combined transport properties of the salt-metal system. MSTTE is a forced convection FLiBe loop with custom designed test section to measure tritium transport through candidate structural materials. We use MSRE relevant dimensionless numbers to design and scale the test section. Hastelloy N is a candidate loop and test section material due to the relevance for the MSRE and related designs, however, other metals are being considered (e.g. 316H SS) which may better align with current vendor concepts.},

	abstract = {Time-modulated helium (He) ion energy (e.g. VBias  =  −50  +  25·sin(2πfRF · t), fRF  =  13.56 MHz) is demonstrated to strongly affect the development of tungsten (W) surface morphology that results from He plasma irradiation in the DIONISOS linear plasma experiment. Nano-tendril bundles (NTBs), which appear as isolated ‘islands’ of nano-tendrils, can rapidly grow on an otherwise smooth W surface. This is in contrast to previously seen full-surface coverage of nano-tendril growth known as ‘fuzz’. When tall NTBs form, less than 15\% of the surface contains nano-tendrils. The NTB surface coverage changes with growth conditions and the total volume of nano-tendrils in the NTBs is observed to be up to a factor of 16 larger than when fuzz is grown. This indicates that long-range W surface transport underlies nano-tendril formation. Surface temperature 870–1220 K, the DC bias potential  −30 to  −70 V, and the ion flux density 4.4  ×  1021–1.1  ×  1022 He · m−2 · s−1 are varied in the experiments. NTBs form at similar conditions as fuzz with the critical difference being the RF modulation of the ion energy bombarding the W, another indication of the importance of W surface transport. Mass loss measurements indicate net erosion with a yield of 1–8  ×  10−4 W/He when NTBs form; erosion that is not attributable to chemical or physical sputtering by He or impurities in the plasma. The erosion is correlated to the NTB growth, based on post-exposure inspection by electron microscopy indicating that NTBs are prone to loss from the surface. NTB growth is compared to the empirical growth-erosion model of fuzz, showing NTBs grow up to a factor of 100 times taller than the expected fuzz layer depth under DC bias conditions. Insights into nano-tendril growth provided by this new growth regime are discussed. Strategies to mitigate W fuzz growth may inadvertently result in rapid localized nano-tendril bundle growth with a higher probability of dust production.},

An exact analytical transport solution in cylindrical coordinates was fit to the measured permeation data, and this analysis derived deuterium diffusion and solubility coefficients of 8.0×10−10 m2/s and 3.1×10−4 mol/m3Pa at 600 °C, respectively, and 3.0×10−9 m2/s and 1.0×10−4 mol/m3Pa at 650 °C. The diffusion coefficients were about a factor of two less than previous results derived from capillary-reservoir diffusion measurements with tritium.

In nuclear fission and fusion power plants, high heat capacity molten salts allow operation at high temperature and atmospheric pressure, which could dramatically increase efficiency, reduce capital cost, and enable passive safety features.

Diffusion-limiting permeation was confirmed by experimental data where hydrogen permeation rates were in reverse proportion to the thickness of Flinak. Diffusivities determined in the range of 500–750°C were correlated to an Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 50kJ/mol. Since the dependence of hydrogen solubility in Flinak on pressure was almost linear, hydrogen was dissolved as H2 in Flinak. The H2 solubility in Flinak was correlated to a Henry law, and its solubility constant was discussed in terms of macroscopic surface tension and unspecified interaction energy between the molten salt and dissolved gaseous molecules.},

We present a new accelerator-based facility for rapid, simultaneous testing of molten salt-facing materials utilizing a proton beam as the radiation source. Introducing proton irradiation to a molten salt corrosion system poses specific engineering concerns in sample and corrosion cell design, operational stability, integration with the accelerator beamline, and radiation safety.

	abstract = {Recent developments in high-magnetic-field fusion systems have created large incentives to develop flibe (Li2BeF4) salt fusion blankets that have four functions: (1) convert the high energy of fusion neutrons into heat for the power system, (2) convert lithium into tritium—the fusion fuel, (3) shield the magnets against radiation, and (4) cool the first wall that separates the plasma from the salt blanket. Flibe is the same coolant proposed for fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactors that use clean flibe coolant and graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel. Flibe is also the coolant proposed for some molten salt reactors (MSRs) where the fuel is dissolved in the coolant. The multiple applications for flibe as a coolant create large incentives for cooperative fusion-fission programs for development of the underlying science, design tools, technology (pumps, instrumentation, salt purification, materials, tritium removal, etc.), and supply chains. Other high-temperature molten salts are being developed for alternative MSR systems and for advanced Gen-III concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. The overlapping characteristics of flibe salt with these other salt systems create significant incentives for cooperative fusion-fission-solar programs in multiple areas.We describe the fission and fusion flibe-cooled systems, what has created this synergism, what is different and the same between fission and fusion in terms of using flibe, and the common challenges. We review (1) the characteristics of flibe salts, (2) the status of the technology, (3) the options for tritium capture and control in the salt, heat exchangers, and secondary heat transfer loops, and (4) the coupling to power cycles with heat storage. The technology overlap between flibe systems and other high-temperature MSR and CSP salt systems is described. This defines where there are opportunities for cooperative programs across fission, fusion, and CSP salt programs.},

Some factors which would affect the tritium supply and doubling time were considered, such as the tritium fractional burnup in the plasma, tritium breeding ratio (TBR), the residence time of tritium in all subsystems, and tritium decay, etc. The results showed that the minimum tritium supply for startup was sensitive with the tritium fractional burnup in the plasma, but the effect of the TBR could be neglected. The double time for tritium breeding strongly depended on the TBR and the tritium fractional burnup. Based on the model, the analysis results predicted that the required initial minimum tritium supply was ∼9.9kg for startup. After one year's operation, the total tritium inventory in fuel cycle system was ∼33kg. And the total tritium release into environment was ∼4mg, which was much lower than the allow level, i.e. 1g-T/year. The tritium in fuel storage system would be doubled and could be extracted to supply for the other fusion power reactor's startup after ∼886days operation.},

	abstract = {New simulation results are predicted in a fusion reactor operation process. They are somewhat similar to, but quite different from, the xenon poisoning effects resulting from ﬁssion-produced iodine during the restart-up process of a ﬁssion reactor. We obtained completely new results of tritium well depth and tritium well time in magnetic conﬁnement fusion energy research area. This study is carried out to investigate the following: what will be the least amount of tritium storage required to start up a fusion reactor and how long the fusion reactor needs to be operated for achieving the tritium break-even during the initial start-up phase due to the ﬁnite tritium-breeding time, which is dependent on the tritium breeder, speciﬁc structure of the breeding zone, layout of the coolant ﬂow pipes, tritium recovery scheme and applied extraction process, the tritium retention of plasma facing component (PFC) and other reactor components, unrecoverable tritium fraction in the breeder, leakage to the inertial gas container and the natural radioactive decay time constant. We describe these new issues and answer these problems by setting up and solving a set of equations, which are described by a dynamic subsystem model of tritium inventory evolution in a fusion experimental breeder (FEB). Reasonable results are obtained using our simulation model. It is found that the tritium well depth is about 0.319 kg and the tritium well time is approximately 235 full power operation days for the reference case of the designed FEB conﬁguration, and it is also found that after one-year operation the tritium storage reaches 0.767 kg, which is more than the least amount of tritium storage required to start up another FEB-like fusion reactor. The results show that the tritium retention in the PFC is equivalent to 11.9\% of tritium well depth that is fairly consistent with the result of 10–20\% deduced from the integrated particle balance of European tokamaks. Based on our experimental and theoretical studies, some new mechanisms are proposed for reducing the tritium retention in PFC and structure materials of tritium-breeding blanket. In this paper, a qualitative analysis of the ‘sponge effect’ is carried out. The ‘sponge effect’ may help us to reduce tritium retention by ∼20\% in the PFC.},

	abstract = {The breeding blanket with integrated first wall (FW) is the key nuclear component for power extraction, tritium fuel sustainability, and radiation shielding in fusion reactors. The ITER device will address plasma burn physics and plasma support technology, but it does not have a breeding blanket. Current activities to develop “roadmaps” for realizing fusion power recognize the blanket/FW as one of the principal remaining challenges. Therefore, a central element of the current planning activities is focused on the question: what are the research and major facilities required to develop the blanket/FW to a level which enables the design, construction and successful operation of a fusion DEMO? The principal challenges in the development of the blanket/FW are: (1) the Fusion Nuclear Environment – a multiple-field environment (neutrons, heat/particle fluxes, magnetic field, etc.) with high magnitudes and steep gradients and transients; (2) Nuclear Heating in a large volume with sharp gradients – the nuclear heating drives most blanket phenomena, but accurate simulation of this nuclear heating can be done only in a DT-plasma based facility; and (3) Complex Configuration with blanket/first wall/divertor inside the vacuum vessel – the consequence is low fault tolerance and long repair/replacement time. These blanket/FW development challenges result in critical consequences: (a) non-fusion facilities (laboratory experiments) need to be substantial to simulate multiple fields/multiple effects and must be accompanied by extensive modeling; (b) results from non-fusion facilities will be limited and will not fully resolve key technical issues. A DT-plasma based fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) is required to perform “multiple effects” and “integrated” experiments in the fusion nuclear environment; and (c) the Reliability/Availability/Maintainability/Inspectability (RAMI) of fusion nuclear components is a major challenge and is one of the primary reasons why the blanket/FW will pace fusion development toward a DEMO. This paper summarizes the top technical issues and elucidates the primary challenges in developing the blanket/first wall and identifies the key R\&D needs in non-fusion and fusion facilities on the path to DEMO.},

	abstract = {The divertor target plates are the most thermally loaded in-vessel components in a fusion reactor where high heat fluxes are produced on the plasma-facing components (PFCs) by intense plasma bombardment, radiation and nuclear heating. For reliable exhaust of huge thermal power, robust and durable divertor target PFCs with a sufficiently large heat removal capability and lifetime has to be developed. Since 2014 in the framework of the preconceptual design activities of the EUROfusion DEMO project, integrated R\&D efforts have been made in the subproject ‘Target development’ of the work package ‘Divertor’ to develop divertor target PFCs for DEMO. Recently, the first R\&D phase was concluded where six (partly novel) target PFC concepts were developed and evaluated by means of non-destructive inspections and high-heat-flux fatigue testing. In this paper, the major achievements of the first phase activities in this subproject are presented focusing on the design rationales of the target PFC concepts, technology options employed for small-scale mock-up fabrication and the results of the first round high-heat-flux qualification test campaign. It is reported that the mock-ups of three PFC concepts survived up to 500 loading cycles at 20 MW/m² (with hot water cooling at 130 °C) without any discernable indication of degradation in performance or structural integrity.},

The design evolved from a previous design of which six mock-ups were designed, fabricated and subjected to high heat flux testing. The new design was generated using optimisation techniques; specifically, software was developed to automatically process the design of experiments data to enable visualisation of the design space. Despite the more challenging geometric constraints of this second phase, this design performs significantly better than that of the previous phase; the strain in the interlayer, which was the dominant damage mode in the phase 1 testing, is reduced by 28\%. Four mock-ups of the selected design were manufactured, all of which successfully passed a series of high heat flux testing, including 500 cycles at 20 MW/m2. Design optimisation methods are not widely utilised in fusion engineering, their potential benefits, which are demonstrated here on a plasma facing component, could be applied to many other challenging designs.},

	abstract = {Helium plasma is known to affect recrystallization in tungsten, with lower temperatures during plasma exposure leading to slower crystal grain growth. To understand why this occurs, tungsten samples were first exposed to helium plasma at surface temperatures between 300°C and 800°C, before annealing at temperatures between 1100°C and 1400°C. Annealing after helium exposure at 300°C was confirmed to lead to smaller crystal grains than annealing after exposure to helium at 500°C. Small 1-2 nm radius nanobubbles formed readily in tungsten after helium plasma exposure, but disappear after annealing at temperatures of 1100°C and above. The formation of cracks and open volumes beneath the surface was observed exclusively in tungsten exposed to helium-plasma at 300°C, with extensive surface cracks visible after annealing. These cracks were not observed for higher temperature helium exposure and likely form due to the strong tendency of bubbles to cluster along grain boundaries for helium exposure at 300°C. Despite this, nano-mechanical testing revealed a similar influence of annealing conditions on tungsten hardness for all plasma exposure conditions studied. The crack formation is likely caused by interactions between solute helium and residual defects from surface polishing.},

This paper summarizes the work carried out to identify the EU-DEMO baseline operating point and the underpinning assumptions about technology and physics performance. The major design choices are described and the principle drivers for the direction of conceptual development, resulting in the operating space for EU-DEMO, are identified. The final output of the systems code forms the basis for more detailed engineering and physics evaluation and design work.},

The diffusivities from 200K to 3000K are calculated and the diffusion equation is fitted to D=5.13×10−8exp(−0.21eV/kT)m2/s. The diffusion equations in different temperature ranges of 200–500K, 500–2400K and 2400–3000K are also given separately and the results imply different H diffusion modes in different temperature ranges, which is proved by analyzing equilibrium H positions at low and high temperatures. The H atom jumps between different tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) at lower temperatures, but the transition to octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) is also observed at high temperatures. Moreover, with a vacancy present in the W system, vacancy trapping of H is observed, and it is shown that the vacancy trapping reduces with the increasing temperature. The H binding energy to monovacancy is obtained using three different methods including NEB and fitting both H diffusivity and time for H to detrap from the vacancy, which provides more information of the H behaviors with the existence of defects.},

	abstract = {Influence of hydrogen concentration and defects introduced by neutron irradiation on hydrogen diffusion in tungsten has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation at elevated temperatures. Hydrogen diffusion is shown to be significantly restrained at high concentrations due to spontaneous formation of platelet-like hydrogen clusters. For neutron irradiation defects, self-interstitials, mono-vacancies and vacancy clusters are considered. By clustering and acting as dislocation loops, self-interstitials show considerable trapping effects on hydrogen, leading to the suppression of hydrogen effective diffusion and the change of diffusion model in which hydrogen mainly diffuses along dislocation lines instead of hopping between tetrahedral interstitial sites. Moreover, an equation connecting hydrogen diffusion parameters and the total length of dislocation loops is empirically established. Different influences of mono-vacancies and vacancy clusters on hydrogen diffusion have been carefully identified. With the same vacancy concentration, hydrogen diffusivity is lower with mono-vacancies than that with vacancy clusters because more isolated trapping sites are provided by mono-vacancies. This work is not only helpful for understanding the synergistic effects of neutron irradiation and plasma interaction, but also potentially applicable for larger scale simulations as input data.},

	abstract = {In future fusion devices, tungsten (W) and W-based alloys are the primary candidates for plasma facing materials, which experience high-energy neutron and high-flux hydrogen (H) isotopes and helium. Since mono-vacancy and di-vacancy are considered respectively as the common point defect and cluster under irradiation, the interaction between H and vacancies is concerned. In this work, the models to abstract the dynamical parameters, including the effective capture radii (ECRs) and dissociation coefficients, for various trapping and dissociation processes (VnHx + H ⇌ VnHx+1), were firstly extended based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was found that the ECRs and dissociation coefficients are dependent not only on the reaction types but also on the temperatures. As the increase of the trapped H atoms in the mono-/di-vacancy, the ECRs decrease gradually and the dissociation energies of H decrease gradually. It is not always valid that ECR is commonly assumed as one lattice constant or pre-exponential factor is commonly assumed as 10 ps−1. The number of trapped H in the vacancies should be related to the dwell time, and is also related to the temperature. These results should be potentially applicable for the long-term simulation methods such as kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) and rate theory (RT) models.},

	abstract = {Lithium-based molten salts have attracted signiﬁcant attention due to their applications in energy storage, advanced ﬁssion reactors, and fusion devices. Lithium ﬂuorides and particularly 66.6\%LiF−33.3\%BeF2 (Flibe) are of considerable interest in nuclear systems, as they show an excellent combination of favorable heat transfer, neutron moderation, and transmutation characteristics. For nuclear salts, the range of possible local structures, compositions, and thermodynamic conditions presents signiﬁcant challenges in atomistic modeling. In this work, we demonstrate that atomcentered neural network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) provide a fast method for performing molecular dynamics of molten salts that is as accurate as ab initio molecular dynamics. For LiF, these potentials are able to accurately reproduce ab initio interactions of dimers, crystalline solids under deformation, crystalline LiF near the melting point, and liquid LiF at high temperatures. For Flibe, NNIPs accurately predict the structures and dynamics at normal operating conditions, high-temperature− pressure conditions, and in the crystalline solid phase. Furthermore, we show that NNIP-based molecular dynamics of molten salts are scalable to reach long time scales (e.g., nanosecond) and large system sizes (e.g., 105 atoms) while maintaining ab initio density functional theory accuracy and providing more than 3 orders of magnitude of computational speedup for calculating structure and transport properties.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1777267-tritium-transport-phenomena-molten-salt-reactors},
	abstract = {In this work, we review phenomena relevant to tritium transport in molten-salt reactors, which produce tritium from lithium and beryllium salts at significantly higher levels than other reactor types. Modeling of such phenomena began following MSRE operations, and these early models attempted to predict measured tritium distributions in the MSRE, accounting for turbulent mass-transport processes (using established heat transfer correlations), permeation through a variety of metal structures such as heat exchanger tubes, and transport to and from bubbles introduced into the salt by gas sparging. The models reasonably reproduced the MSRE data, but did so best when the permeability of structures was reduced by about a factor of 1,000. This issue does not appear to have been conclusively resolved, and all of the more recent attempts to model tritium transport in molten salts appear to make use of the same methodology. MSRE remains, however, essentially our only source of integral tritium transport data relevant to MSRs. Here, we generalize the MSRE approach to permeation in order to include potential rate-limiting effects at interfaces, as well the effects of added hydrogen. Appropriately non-dimensionalized, this system of equations identifies two dimensionless numbers whose relative values clearly delineate the conditions under which mass transport, surface effects, permeation, and hydrogen swamping are expected to become rate-limiting. We also describe the preliminary conceptual design of a forced convection FLiBe loop, into which tritium would be introduced for the purpose of providing validation data for such a model. The primary purpose of this is to investigate the coupled transport phenomena described above and identify those that are rate-limiting in MSRs. Additional test section configurations are described that would address other transport phenomena relevant to MSRs, including bubbly flows and graphite interactions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO$_{\textrm{2}}$) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emissions (E$_{\textrm{FOS}}$) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E$_{\textrm{LUC}}$), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (G$_{\textrm{ATM}}$) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ sink (S$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}$) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ sink (S$_{\textrm{LAND}}$) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (B$_{\textrm{IM}}$), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \&plusmn;1\&sigma;. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our E$_{\textrm{LUC}}$ estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries\&rsquo; climate progress.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}For the year 2020, E$_{\textrm{FOS}}$ declined by 5.4\&thinsp;\% relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ (9.3\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ when the cement carbonation sink is included), E$_{\textrm{LUC}}$ was 0.9\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$, for a total anthropogenic CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emission of 10.2\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ (37.4\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;2.9\&thinsp;GtCO$_{\textrm{2}}$). Also, for 2020, G$_{\textrm{ATM}}$ was 5.0\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ (2.4\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), S$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}$ was 3.0\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.4\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ and S$_{\textrm{LAND}}$ was 2.9\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$, with a B$_{\textrm{IM}}$ of \&minus;0.8\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. The global atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm. Preliminary data for 2021, suggest a rebound in E$_{\textrm{FOS}}$ relative to 2020 of +4.9\&thinsp;\% (4.1\&thinsp;\% to 5.7\&thinsp;\%) globally.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\&ndash;2020, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ flux in the northern extra- tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Qu\&eacute;r\&eacute; et al., 2018b, 2018a, 2016, 2015b, 2015a, 2014, 2013).

	abstract = {A loss of vacuum accident (LOVA) is a unique event in fusion reactors. A reference event for ITER was postulated which was a failure of a penetration line (0.02 m2 cross-section) into a room with stack ventilation. Behavior of ingress air and environmental release of the inventory were calculated by an accident analysis code (MELCOR). No in-vessel component cooling was assumed because of a non-safety system and 1350 g-T as tritium (HTO) and 30 kg as tokamak dust (tungsten) were set in the vacuum vessel (VV) as the initial mobile inventory. Operation of the maintenance detritiation system (MDS) after 1 h was credited to limit the release. The analytical results showed that the environmental release of tritium (19 g-T) from the stack was a factor of 5 below the accidental release limit for ITER, and the release of dust (21 g) from the stack is a factor of 25 below the release limit. To investigate the ultimate safety margin, a hypothetical event was also analyzed which was a failure of a penetration line (0.2 m2 cross-section) into a room with ground level ventilation. Since the best estimate analysis assumed in-vessel cooling, which resulted in cooling down the walls, the mobile tritium inventory was reduced to 390 g-T. The large break size caused fast pressurization of the VV and thus the whole dust inventory (110 kg) was expected to be mobile. The ground level release was less than half of the no-evacuation limit under conservative weather conditions.},

In this study, the tritium production rate in CANDU reactor was simulated and estimated. And other possible routes, including Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT), tritium production in Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR) and Accelerator Driven Subcritical system (ADS), were also evaluated in feasibility and economy. Based on the tritium requirement investigated according to ITER test schedule and startup inventory required for a FDS-II-scale DEMO calculated by TAS1.0, the assessment results showed that after ITER retired in 2038, the tritium inventory of CANDU reactor could not afford DEMO reactor startup without extra resource.},

The tokamak vessel will be fuelled through gas puffing and pellet injection, and the Neutral Beam heating system will introduce deuterium into the machine. Employing deuterium and tritium as fusion fuel will cause alpha heating of the plasma and will eventually provide energy. Due to the small burn-up fraction in the vacuum vessel a closed deuterium–tritium loop is required, along with all the auxiliary systems necessary for the safe handling of tritium. The ITER inner fuel cycle systems are designed to process considerable and unprecedented deuterium–tritium flow rates with high flexibility and reliability. High decontamination factors for effluent and release streams and low tritium inventories in all systems are needed to minimize chronic and accidental emissions. A multiple barrier concept assures the confinement of tritium within its respective processing components; atmosphere and vent detritiation systems are essential elements in this concept. Not only the interfaces between the primary fuel cycle systems – being procured through different Participant Teams – but also those to confinement systems such as Atmosphere Detritiation or those to fuelling and pumping – again procured through different Participant Teams – and interfaces to buildings are calling for definition and for detailed analysis to assure proper design integration.

	copyright = {Licence Etalab},
	url = {http://www.theses.fr/2019LYSEE005},
	abstract = {Les réacteurs de fusion thermonucléaire proposent de confiner magnétiquement un plasma dans le but d’obtenir les conditions de pression et de température favorables à la réaction de fusion pour produire de l'électricité en «quasi-continu». Cependant, le confinement est imparfait et, en raison de la configuration magnétique, les pertes d’énergétiques sont dirigées vers les parois internes du réacteur, appelées composants à face de plasma (CFPs), et en particulier dans la partie inférieure de la machine appelée divertor. Pour ITER, ces flux de particules peuvent impliquer une température de surface des CFPs de l'ordre de 2000°C cycliquement maintenue pendant des temps allant de quelques millisecondes à quelques secondes. Pour résister à de telles sollicitations, les CFPs des divertors ITER et WEST sont constitués de blocs de tungstène (W) pur utilisé comme matériau d’armure et assemblés sur un tube de refroidissement en CuCrZr (matériau de structure) dans lequel circule de l’eau. Ces CPFs doivent assurer l'intégrité mécanique des parois internes de la machine, l'extraction de la chaleur et doivent être compatibles avec les espèces chimiques en présence au sein du plasma pour ne pas compromettre son exploitation. Critique pour le fonctionnement du plasma et l’intégrité du réacteur, ces CFPs représentent l’une des principales pièces du réacteur. Ainsi, plusieurs campagnes expérimentales ont été réalisées pour valider cette technologie avant son exploitation en l’environnement tokamak. Bien que cette technologie réponde aux spécifications ITER, les composants s’endommagent au cours des cycles thermiques. Des fissures apparaissent dans le bloc de W après quelques dizaines (voire quelques centaines) de cycles thermiques à 20 MW/m². Cette fissure se propage de la surface exposée aux flux vers le tube de refroidissement. L’apparition de cette fissure n’affecte pas immédiatement la capacité du composant à extraire la chaleur. Néanmoins, cela entraîne des problèmes d’intégrité mécanique des parois internes de la machine et pourrait limiter l’exploitation du plasma. Ainsi, afin d'optimiser leur usage en environnement tokamak, il est nécessaire d'étudier le processus d'endommagement de ces composants et d'estimer leur durée de vie en fonction des chargements thermiques attendus. Dans la littérature, plusieurs modèles numériques ont été développés et ont permis d'identifier les principaux phénomènes impliqués dans le processus d'endommagement des composants. Pour améliorer la prédiction des outils numériques existants, cette thèse a pour objectif de développer un modèle numérique capable de prendre en compte la recristallisation du W; phénomène mentionné dans la littérature comme jouant un rôle important sur la durée de vie des composants. Le modèle numérique final développé (RXMAT) est intégré au code éléments finis ANSYS. Ce nouvel outil numérique est alimenté par les cinétiques de recristallisation du W étudiées jusqu'à 1800 ° C et par les lois de comportement élasto-viscoplastique du matériau identifiées à partir d’essais expérimentaux réalisés de 500°C à 1150°C et à plusieurs vitesses de déformation.Pour la première fois, il est possible de lier numériquement l'évolution de la fraction recristallisée du W à un champ de contraintes et de déformations mécaniques. En comparant les résultats obtenus avec des études de la littérature, on montre qu'en utilisant RXMAT des déformations plastiques équivalentes 10 fois supérieures sont estimées. Ces premiers résultats laissent envisager de nombreuses applications. Celles-ci permettraient par  exemple de mieux comprendre l'influence de la géométrie, des propriétés de convection et des cinétiques de recristallisation sur l'accumulation de la déformation plastique équivalente au sein du composant. RXMAT pourrait également être utilisée pour étudier le processus d'endommagement du composant exposé à un flux thermique non homogène, représentatif de l'environnement du tokamak.},

In this study, bulk beryllium limiter tiles, plasma-facing beryllium coated Inconel components from the main chamber, bulk tungsten and tungsten coated carbon fibre composite divertor tiles were analysed. A range of methods have been developed and applied in order to obtain a comprehensive overview on tritium retention and behaviour in different materials of plasma facing components (PFCs). Tritium content and chemical state were studied by the means of chemical or electrochemical dissolution methods and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Tritium distribution in the vacuum vessel and factors affecting its accumulation have been assessed and discussed.},

	abstract = {The interaction processes between the burning plasma and the ﬁrst wall in a fusion reactor are diverse: the ﬁrst wall will be exposed to extreme thermal loads of up to several tens of megawatts per square meter during quasistationary operation, combined with repeated intense thermal shocks (with energy densities of up to several megajoules per square meter and pulse durations on a millisecond time scale). In addition to these thermal loads, the wall will be subjected to bombardment by plasma ions and neutral particles (D, T, and He) and by energetic neutrons with energies up to 14 MeV. Hopefully, ITER will not only demonstrate that thermonuclear fusion of deuterium and tritium is feasible in magnetic conﬁnement regimes; it will also act as a ﬁrst test device for plasma-facing materials (PFMs) and plasma-facing components (PFCs) under realistic synergistic loading scenarios that cover all the above-mentioned load types. In the absence of an integrated test device, material tests are being performed primarily in specialized facilities that concentrate only on the most essential material properties. New multipurpose test facilities are now available that can also focus on more complex loading scenarios and thus help to minimize the risk of an unexpected material or component failure. Thermonuclear fusion—both with magnetic and with inertial conﬁnement—is making great progress, and the goal of scientiﬁc break-even will be reached soon. However, to achieve that end, signiﬁcant technical problems, particularly in the ﬁeld of high-temperature and radiation-resistant materials, must be solved. With ITER, the ﬁrst nuclear reactor that burns a deuterium–tritium plasma with a fusion power gain Q ≥ 10 will start operation in the next decade. To guarantee safe operation of this rather sophisticated fusion device, new PFMs and PFCs that are qualiﬁed to withstand the harsh environments in such a tokamak reactor have been developed and are now entering the manufacturing stage.},

The tritiated gas exhausted from the process described above is foreseen to be treated by a tubular Pd–Ag membrane reactor, for gaseous tritium recovery. Since this membrane reactor uses hydrogen as swamping gas the compatibility toward explosive hazard has to be taken into account. Then, this work presents a double objective. A first study is presented in order to identify the best conditions for the declassification of soft housekeeping waste, without tritium recovery. Experiments carried out at 120°C are not efficient enough and do not allow one to choose the most efficient carrier gas. Some other tests are being currently performed at higher temperatures (150°C). Moreover, due to safety issues, the use of air has to be avoided during membrane reactor implementation phase. Preliminary results obtained with hydrogen hazard-free carrier gases are also presented.},

	abstract = {Arcing has been identified in a large number of tokamaks by the characteristic cathode arc tracks which are left on surfaces exposed to the plasma. This evidence has led to a discussion as to whether sputtering or arcing is more important as a mechanism for producing impurities. The two processes are difficult to distinguish because both can be driven by the electric field of the sheath potential at the boundary surface. Recent time-resolved measurements in DITE, ISX, PLT, and T10 have shown that arcing occurs predominantly at the beginning of the discharge and is probably due to MHD activity. Although the impurity influx is enhanced during arcing it does occur during the whole length of the discharge. Thus, it appears that some mechanisms other than arcing must be responsible. New evidence on the flux and energy of ions arriving at the limiter indicates that the sputtering of the limiter may be larger than previously realised. This and other evidence in favour of sputtering is reviewed.},

Here, we report results from periodic density-functional theory calculations for three crucial aspects of this interaction: surface-to-subsurface diffusion of H into W, trapping of H at vacancies, and H-enhanced decohesion, with a view to assess the likely extent of hydrogen isotope incorporation into tungsten reactor walls. We find energy barriers of (at least) 2.08 eV and 1.77 eV for H uptake (inward diffusion) into W(001) and W(110) surfaces, respectively, along with very small barriers for the reverse process (outward diffusion). Although H dissolution in defect-free bulk W is predicted to be endothermic, vacancies in bulk W are predicted to exothermically trap multiple H atoms. Furthermore, adsorbed hydrogen is predicted to greatly stabilize W surfaces such that decohesion (fracture) may result from high local H concentrations.},

Hydrogen adsorption structures were examined from low coverage to one monolayer, and a threefold hollow site was found to be the most stable site at all coverages. In contrast to previous assertions, the work function decrease is not due to electron transfer from the hydrogen atoms to the W surface, but due to electron depletion at the vacuum region above the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms can diffuse via short-bridge sites and long-bridge sites at a coverage of θ=1.0. Although the calculated activation energy for hydrogen diffusion via a short-bridge site is as small as 0.05eV, field emission microscope experiments have shown that the activation energy for hydrogen diffusion is about 0.20eV, which agrees fairly well with our calculated value of the activation energy via a long-bridge site. This discrepancy can be related to hydrogen delocalization on the W(110) surface, which has been suggested by electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments.},

	abstract = {Using a molecular beam technique, accurate dissociative adsorption sticking probabilities are reported for both H2 and D2 interacting with W\{100\}, over a wide range of surface and beam temperatures, and of surface coverage. By following the scattering of HD and D2 from the crystal surface produced from mixed beams of H2 and D2, isothermal desorption data have also been obtained at crystal temperatures between 380 and 480 K which yield model-independent variations of desorption activation energy and desorption pre-exponential factors with surface coverage. Within an experimental accuracy of 5\%, no isotope effect was observed in adsorption or desorption kinetics for H2 and D2. The sticking probability s falls linearly with coverage, according to the expression s = (0.72 − 5.4 × 10−4\{T\}B) (1 − θ2) where TB is the gas temperature; s is independent of substrate temperature over the range 200 to 1150 K. The data indicate no influence of trapping into a precursor state. At low coverages the desorption energy Ed is 159 kJ mol−1, falling precipitately at θ = 0.46 to 88 kJmol−1. At the same coverage, the desorption pre-exponential term v falls by a factor of 107. The results are discussed in terms of the known adsorbate-induced, coverage-dependent displacive phase transition which occurs for this system. It is proposed that at low coverages desorption occurs with a normal pre-exponential (of 7 × 1015 s−1) from the localised pinched dimer structure; above θ = 0.5, however, desorption occurs from a delocalised ad-layer, with a low pre-exponential factor ({\textasciitilde} 4 × 108 s−1). Since the adsorbate is localised at all coverages at 300 K, it is further proposed that a localised-delocalised phase transition, with ΔS ≈ 60 J mol−1 K−1 and ΔH ≈ 21 kJ mol−1, occurs between 300 K and the desorption temperature.},

The excitation energy of a confined helium atom is known to differ from that of a free atom being greater in both the bulk liquid or solid or a bubble confined in a metallic matrix state. We compare calculations for the energy shift with both laboratory experiments for bulk systems and results derived from scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies of helium nanobubbles embedded in different matrices. We find excellent agreement between our calculations and the latest extensive measurements in the bulk. However, we find significant discrepancies when we compare with results deduced using the ‘standard’ approach for analysing STEM data. Here, we show the scattering matrix element determining the intensity of this excitation in a STEM experiment is significantly affected by the same environmental factors that shift the excitation energy. Consequently, there is a serious theoretical inconsistency in the way the STEM results are calculated, in that the ‘standard’ approach depends on a supposedly known scattering cross section, whereas we show here that this cross section is itself dependent on the environment. Correcting for this inconsistency does not, in itself, improve agreement.},

	abstract = {La rétention des isotopes de l’hydrogène (HI) et de l’hélium (He) dans les composants de la première paroi (PFC) est un enjeu majeur pour les futurs réacteurs tels ITER et DEMO, les conditions d’exposition au plasma de fusion pouvant entrainer la dégradation des matériaux. Les propriétés du tungstène (W), ont entrainés son choix pour le divertor d’ITER: lors des phases deutérium/tritium, les PFC W seront soumis à d’intenses flux de particules, HI, He, neutrons ou encore impuretés issues du plasma de bord. L’impact de l’He est particulièrement problématique, avec un endommagement significatif de la zone de proche surface dans le W: création de boucles de dislocations, bulles, ou W-fuzz. En outre, en présence d’oxygène résiduel, une oxydation de surface est possible du fait de la température élevée du divertor. La modification de la structure du W peut considérablement modifier les propriétés du matériau, et donc son espérance de vie face au plasma, ainsi que sa rétention en hydrogène, ce qui pose un problème de sureté dans le cas du tritium, qui est radioactif. Cette thèse a permis d’étudier les mécanismes fondamentaux du piégeage et la rétention de HI dans le W, grâce notamment à l’implantation par faisceau d’ions et la spectroscopie par thermo desorption (TDS), en fonction de différents états de surface: - Présence d’une couche d’oxide en surface d’un W polycristallin, formées dans des conditions pertinentes pour ITER; - Présence des modifications liées à une exposition à l’He proches de celles attendues dans ITER. Les mesures TDS ont été couplées avec des observations de microscopie afin de caractériser les modifications dans la surface et la structure du matériau},

It was found that for single crystals, the critical formation dose is one order of magnitude higher than for polycrystalline tungsten at high temperature irradiation conditions. Upon reducing the irradiation temperature to ambient, the critical dose for formation of blisters in single crystals was reduced by a factor of three while in polycrystalline tungsten there was no significant change with temperature, thus indicating the role of grain boundaries in blister formation. Larger blisters were obtained in single crystals than in polycrystalline tungsten at ambient temperature conditions, identifying the grain boundaries as a preferential additional hydrogen trap.

	abstract = {Tungsten (W) has been regarded as one of the most promising plasma facing materials (PFMs) in fusion reactors. The formation of bubbles and blisters during hydrogen (H) irradiation will affect the properties of W. The dependence of implantation conditions, such as fluence and energy, is therefore of great interest. In this work, polycrystalline tungsten samples were separated into two groups for study. The thick samples were implanted by 18 keV H3+ ions to fluences of 1 × 1018, 1 × 1019 and 1 × 1020 H+/cm2, respectively. Another thick sample was also implanted by 80 keV H2+ ions to a fluence of 2 × 1017 H+/cm2 for comparison. Moreover, the thin samples were implanted by 18 keV H3+ ions to fluences of 9.38 × 1016, 1.88 × 1017 and 5.63 × 1017 H+/cm2, respectively. Focused ion beam (FIB) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for micro-structure analysis, while time-of-flight ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to characterize the H depth profile. It is indicated that bubbles and blisters could form successively with increasing H+ fluence. H bubbles are formed at a fluence of ∼ 5.63 × 1017 H+/cm2, and H blisters are formed at ∼ 1 × 1019 H+/cm2 for 18 keV H3+ implantation. On the other hand, 80 keV H2+ ions can create more trapping sites in a shallow projected range, and thus enhancing the blisters formation with a relatively lower fluence of 2 × 1017 H+/cm2. The crack-like microstructures beneath the blisters are also observed and prefer to form on the deep side of the implanted range.},

Two pre-irradiation heat treatments were done for stress relief (900°C) and recrystallization (1300°C for pure W and 1500°C for K-doped and La2O3-doped W).

However, H bombardment at 1273 K did not lead to the formation of blister-like microstructures. Correspondingly, irradiation hardening occurred after low temperature exposure, but not after high temperature exposure, according to the Berkovich nano-indentation experiments. In order to characterize the indentation size effect and irradiation hardening behavior of plasma-exposed materials, a mechanistic model was proposed for the hardness-depth relationship. A good agreement between the experimental indentation data and theoretical results revealed that plasma-induced dislocations play a dominant role in determining the increase of hardness for H plasma-exposed tungsten.},

	abstract = {Blisters formed at tungsten surfaces due to deuterium ion bombardment have been studied systematically in the energy range 100 eV to 1 keV. The bombardment with 1 keV D+ at room temperature (RT) shows that the blister size increases and the number decreases with the deuterium fluence from 1×1019 to 1×1021D+/cm2. No blisters are found at elevated temperatures between 600 and 800 °C. For bombardment with an energy as low as 100 eV, blisters are observed at the high fluence of 1×1021D+/cm2. The blister size increases and the number decreases with the bombardment energy. Combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ion beam depth profiling measurements have been used to investigate the effect of blister formation on the trapping behavior of deuterium in tungsten. Double implantations, where 4 keV He+ and 100 eV D+, respectively, were injected in W prior to the bombardment of 1 keV D+ show a pronounced increase of deuterium retention and blister disappearance. Possible mechanisms are proposed to describe the observed phenomena.},

This paper aims at giving an overview of the EU HCPB BB Research and Development (R\&D) being developed at KIT, in collaboration with Wigner-RCP, BUTE-INT, and CIEMAT. The paper gives an outline of the HCPB BB design evolution, state-of-the-art basic functionalities, requirements and performances, and the associated R\&D activities in the areas of design, functional materials, manufacturing, and testing. In addition, attention is given also to the activities dedicated to the development of heat transfer augmentation techniques for the first wall and the corresponding testing. Due to their nature as design drivers, a brief overview in the R\&D of key HCPB interfacing areas is given as well, namely, the tritium extraction and recovery system, the primary heat transfer and power conversion systems, and safety topics, as well as some specific activities regarding the integration of in-vessel systems through the BB.

	abstract = {The Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) Breeding Blanket (BB) is one of the 4 BB concepts being investigated in the EU for their possible implementation in DEMO. During 2014 the former “beer-box” BB concept based on the ITER’s HCPB Test Blanket Module suffered several design changes so as to meet the different counteracting nuclear, thermohydraulic and thermomechanical requirements. These studies evidenced that the concept is too rigid to meet the tight TBR requirements imposed for the EU DEMO (i.e. TBR≥1.10). Additionally, the complex manifold system with unbalanced helium mass flow in each of the 2 parallel cooling loops made the concept thermohydraulically complex. However, parametric studies during 2015 revealed that the HCPB concept have potential for a better nuclear performance, as well as margin for a significant simplification of the cooling internals by redefining the cooling plates and the architecture of the blanket, building a symmetric flow scheme. This paper describes the new HCPB concept based on an integrated FW with the breeding zone thermohydraulics and helium manifold systems. The former complex manifold backplates have been compacted and integrated in the cooling plates, releasing ≈300mm of radial space that can be used now to increase breeder zone, the neutron shielding, to reinforce the Back Supporting Structure (BSS) or basically to reduce the reactor size. Detailed neutronic analyses have yielded a TBR of ∼1.20 for the baseline design. Initial analyses show a correct thermohydraulic behavior. Preliminary thermomechanical analyses also indicate that the design can potentially withstand an in-box LOCA at 9 MPa at a level C according to the RCC-MRx code. Future consolidation activities are described, which shall lead to a concept meeting the BB requirements.},

	abstract = {We performed a direct comparison of deuterium retention and release from tungsten in presence or in absence of oxygen impurities. A single crystal of W(110) was used to prepare tungsten with four different surface states: with its native oxide, atomically clean, covered with half a monolayer of oxygen atoms, and covered with three fourths of a monolayer of oxygen atoms. For a D ion fluence of 3 × 1021 D+ m−2 implanted at 300 K, deuterium retention was highest with the native oxide, lowest with three fourths of a monolayer of oxygen atoms at the surface and intermediate for the clean surface. This counterintuitive result is explained by a different localization of deuterium retention in these samples. For tungsten with its native oxide, deuterium retention occurs solely in the bulk, i.e. below the first atomic plane of the surface. For clean tungsten, deuterium retention occurs in part at the surface and sputtering should play a role. For tungsten with a sub-monolayer surface coverage of oxygen atoms, a transition from surface to bulk retention is observed above half a monolayer of adsorbed oxygen. Striking differences in desorption peak(s) temperature(s) are observed between D ion-implanted samples and D2 molecules-exposed samples. These results highlight the importance of the (near-) surface localization of oxygen and deuterium on the temperature dependence of deuterium desorption rate i.e. on the fusion fuel recycling coefficient.},

To get a better understanding and a correction of experimental measures, we investigated the effects of hydrogen trapping on the diffusion of hydrogen through a metallic membrane by simulating a FEM model. The trap binding energy ΔET ranges from −0.1 to −0.32eV, the density of traps ranges between 10−4 and 100mol/m3, and the thickness of the membrane fluctuates from 100μm to 1mm. It appears that the effective diffusion coefficient extracted from desorption flux data of a single membrane is not influenced by its geometry and depends on both the density of trapped hydrogen and the trap binding energy such as the apparent diffusion coefficient implemented in the code. Thus we do not detect any scale effect. In the other hand, the effective subsurface concentration evaluation using usually Fick’s laws doesn’t correspond directly to hydrogen concentration in the membrane. Analytical equations to solve the problem to extract erroneous data (diffusion coefficient and hydrogen concentration) to the experimental measurements of the flux vs time curves have been proposed.},

In this study, the recycling process at tungsten wall based on current CFETR design was modeled. Monte Carlo code SRIM was used to model the implantation of energetic tritium ions into pure tungsten and to get back-scattering fraction of ions and the distribution of implanted tritium ions. The diffusion process of atoms in materials, with recombination at surface as boundary condition, was simulated using numerical approach for both stead and transient state. The total recycling ratio was contributed by fast process (implantation and back scattering) and slow process (diffusion and recombination) and its value nearly equals to 1 for stead state. Temporal dependence of total recycling ratio mainly depended on the slow process and was limited by diffusion coefficient in the bulk near surface and existence of traps in material. For tungsten material with good surface condition, the time of 90\% recycling was characterized as 1 ms and affected by temperature, recombination coefficient and concentration of traps while the thickness of material had less affection. Isotope effect that recycling ratio of tritium was larger than that of deuterium at the same situation was also found in the simulation and this effect may affect particle balance and fueling in D-T plasma operation. A collection of theoretical models to estimate the recycling ratio and its time dependence were also summarized and validated by the simulation results.},

Thermal desorption spectroscopy was used to measure total D retention in one W specimen after D plasma exposure. Glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy was used to measure D depth profiling from the other W specimen exposed to the similar condition, and deep D trapping up to 25 μm was observed. When the normalized D depth profile was used with a reaction-diffusion code TMAP7 to model experimental D desorption behavior, an excellent agreement to experimental results was achieved. The modeling results suggested that the predominate mechanism of the deep D trapping might be D trapping in intrinsic intergranular cracks in ITER-grade W.},

Despite the simplicity of laminar flow problems, they should not be underestimated. Many simple solutions have been applied to real systems with approximating assumptions and, besides, the simpler systems provide models for interpretation of complex systems. The more complex nature of turbulent flow and its limited accessibility to mathematical treatment requires, however, an empirical approach to heat transfer. On the other hand, the study of turbulent flow is not entirely empirical; it is possible to establish certain theoretical bases for the analyses of turbulent transfer processes and an introduction to this complex area is given in Chapter 16.},

	abstract = {Using a beam-plasma discharge device operating on helium (He), tungsten with the fuzz on the surface (Wf) has been formed by irradiating polycrystalline tungsten (W) samples with the He ions energy of ∼150 eV and the fluence of ∼6 × 1024 He/m2 at the temperature of 1273 K. The deuterium (D) retention in Wf annealed at different temperatures was studied by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Before and after annealing at temperatures of 1000,1200,1400 and 1600 K, Wf was irradiated at room temperature by 2 keV D3+(667 eV/D) ions with the fluence of 1021 D/m2, then in-situ TDS was performed after each irradiation. Annealing W above 1200 K clearly changes the retention mechanism of D: the TDS spectrum consisting of multiple peaks changes to an almost single-peak spectrum. Annealing at 1600 K leads to surface smoothing and the decrease of the D retention by a factor of two compared to the annealing at 1000 K. This can be explained by an increase of the reflection coefficient for the flat W surface. However, the D retention in Wf is significantly higher compared to that in W without He plasma exposure even after annealing at 1600 K, because there are still He bubbles in Wf that effectively trap D},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on the performance as deuterium permeation barriers of sputtered amorphous, dense and not fully stoichiometric SiC coatings under relevant conditions for breeder blanket applications in fusion reactors. To do that, we investigate the following effects on permeation values: (i) thermal cycling at 450 °C, (ii) combined thermal cycling and e− irradiation (1.8 MeV up to a total dose of 1 MGy), as well as (iii) oxygen exposure at a temperature of 450 °C during e− irradiation. Data show that the permeation reduction factor (PRF) for the as-deposited SiC coated is ∼10 4, even at the predicted operation temperature for the breeder and it is slightly reduced either by thermal cycling without and during e− irradiation. However, the exposure to oxygen at 450 °C during e− irradiation leads to degradation of the coating and of its PRF of about three orders of magnitude. The origin of the coating degradation is discussed. We also study the D retention and desorption in SiC coatings that were implanted with D at energy of 7.5 keV prior to (as-deposited) and after being submitted to the treatments previously described. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy data show that thermal cycling, without and during e− irradiation, strongly increases the D retention in the coatings and leads to the appearance of D2 desorption peak at temperatures between ∼400-750 °C, whereas e-irradiation during thermal cycling does not significantly change the D retention but shifts to higher temperatures thisD2 desorption peak},

The Sieverts' constants showed a 105-fold increase as the Pb content was increased over the stated composition range. The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead. Availability of the latter estimates permitted testing of three statistical mechanical models against the experimental data. The results were compared with other literature on the H-Li-Pb system.},

The temperature and pressure dependence of the mole fraction xH of hydrogen atoms in the melt at low hydrogen concentration, where Sievert's law is valid, can be described by the following equation: ln(xH√105Pa/PH2) = - A + B/T.

Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2.

The determination of the magnitude and kinetics of the tritium flux from the blanket to the helium cooling loop, along with the design of future tritium extraction systems of the breeding alloy or the He coolant purification system, will be defined on basic transport parameters such as solubility. The unacceptable scattering of Sieverts’ constant values in the historical measurements given by different experimental techniques, suggests that this is a very important and unresolved issue. In this work, it has been experimentally evaluated, using absorption and desorption techniques. The different measurement campaigns have been carried out in the temperature range from 523 to 922K and in the pressure range from 1 to 105Pa. This paper describes the work carried out in the preparation of the facility, the theoretical model developed to process the different results obtained by means of absorption and desorption runs. Final results obtained during several campaigns of measurements are provided. The obtained values of hydrogen solubility through the different campaigns show a similar value for the Sieverts’ constant, and therefore, a very little value for the activation energy in the solution process. Results are compared and discussed. The proposed correlation for hydrogen Sieverts’ constant in Pb–Li from these tests is KS [molm−3Pa−1/2]=8.64×10−3exp(–0.9/RT), R in (kJK−1mol−1).},

	abstract = {In order to provide data on diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of tritium in molten salts for the critical issue of tritium control in the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) program, a two-chamber permeability apparatus separated by a nickel plate had been developed for determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten salts. Descriptions on the permeability apparatus, experimental procedure and the analytical method for determining the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen isotope in molten salts were presented in this paper. To assess the performance of the apparatus, the blank tests without molten salt were conducted at 300-700 degrees C. The results showed that the nickel plate acting as the window for hydrogen isotope permeation in the apparatus seemed to have less effect on experiments of determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten slat at 500-700 degrees C. Furthermore, the applicability of the apparatus with molten salt was also evaluated experimentally, with test experiments of molten Flinak (LiF-NaF-KF) at 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. Diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of hydrogen in molten Flinak can be derived from those test experiments, which were correlated to DFlinak-H = 7.06 x 10(-5) e(-54.9/(RgT)) m(2)/S and SFlinak-H = 1.67 x 10(-7) e(-27.0/(RgT)) mol-H-2/(m(3) Pa).},

Measurements of the annealing of the residual resistivity up to 150°C show that the hydrogen precipitates around room temperature and the precipitation is controlled by diffusion of the hydrogen. Microscope investigations confirm this result and show that the hydrogen precipitates as bubbles which form preferentially at grain boundaries and dislocations. The number of bubbles formed was typically loo{\textasciitilde} m - {\textasciitilde}C.onsideration of bubble growth leads to the conclusion that the increase in bubble volume during growth is due to plastic deformation of the lattice near the bubble and that the precipitation is a diffusion limited process, conclusions which are confirmed by the experimental evidence. A model for the erapping of the dissolved hydrogen a t impurities is also discussed. It is shown that by quenching quickly to low enough temperatures the hydrogen is quenched as in a homogeneous solute phase.},

Then, the tritium release rate into the water was examined by a liquid scintillation counting technique and the surface tritium concentration by a tritium imaging plate technique. The tritium release from the metals is attributed to the release of dissolved tritium by diffusion from the normal interstitial sites, and the first order desorption of trapped one with detrapping energies of 64, 72 and 25kJmol−1 for Cu, Fe and Mo, respectively. Overall release behavior is varied depending on the ratio of dissolved and trapped amounts of tritium.},

	abstract = {Ion driven permeation has been investigated for Cu, Ni and Al under deuteron (30 keV) bombardment with different sample thickness, temperature, incident energy and flux. A time sequence of the permeation rate shows a spike at intermediate temperatures as seen previously, while the maximum permeation rate tends to be saturated at high temperatures. These permeation behaviors have also been observed for Al the surface of which was covered by an oxide not removed by deuteron bombardment. The saturated permeation rate (Jp) is well expressed by Jp = rφ/d (r, φandd are the range of the incident ion, the incident flux, and th e specimen thickness, respectively), which is deduced from the assumption that both the reemission and the permeation are controlled by the diffusion process. According to recombination theory, the permeation rate should be much higher because the reemission is delayed by the surface oxide or other contaminants with small recombination coefficients. Therefore the recombination theory seems not to be applicable for the estimation of the ion driven permeation with high incident energies at above 500 K as made in the present work.},

	abstract = {Obtaining a burning plasma is a critical step towards self-sustaining fusion energy1. A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study α-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},

Research along three complementary axes yielded a wealth of new results. Firstly, the JET plasma programme delivered scenarios suitable for high fusion power and alpha particle (α) physics in the coming D–T campaign (DTE2), with record sustained neutron rates, as well as plasmas for clarifying the impact of isotope mass on plasma core, edge and plasma-wall interactions, and for ITER pre-fusion power operation. The efficacy of the newly installed shattered pellet injector for mitigating disruption forces and runaway electrons was demonstrated. Secondly, research on the consequences of long-term exposure to JET-ILW plasma was completed, with emphasis on wall damage and fuel retention, and with analyses of wall materials and dust particles that will help validate assumptions and codes for design and operation of ITER and DEMO. Thirdly, the nuclear technology programme aiming to deliver maximum technological return from operations in D, T and D–T benefited from the highest D–D neutron yield in years, securing results for validating radiation transport and activation codes, and nuclear data for ITER.},

The LMJ facility is under construction at CEA CESTA near Bordeaux and will provide the experimental capabilities to study High-Energy Density Physics (HEDP). One of its goals is to obtain ignition and burn of DT-filled capsules imploded, through indirect drive scheme, inside rugby-shape hohlraum. The PETAL project consists in the addition of one short-pulse (ps) ultra-high-power, high-energy beam (kJ) to the LMJ facility. PETAL will offer a combination of a very high intensity multi-petawatt beam, synchronized with the nanosecond beams of the LMJ. This combination will expand the LMJ experimental field on HEDP.

	abstract = {Sustainment of Q ∼ 10 operation with a fusion power of ∼500 MW for several hundred seconds is a key mission goal of the ITER Project. Past calculations and simulations predict that these conditions can be produced in high-confinement mode operation (H-mode) at 15 MA relying on only inductive current drive. Earlier development of 15 MA baseline inductive plasma scenarios provided a focal point for the ITER Design Review conducted in 2007–2008. In the intervening period, detailed predictive simulations, supported by experimental demonstrations in existing tokamaks, allow us to assemble an end-to-end specification of this scenario consistent with the final design of the ITER device. Simulations have encompassed plasma initiation, current ramp-up, plasma burn and current ramp-down, and have included density profiles and thermal transport models producing temperature profiles consistent with edge pedestal conditions present in current fusion experiments. These quasi-stationary conditions are maintained due to the presence of edge-localized modes that limit the edge pressure. High temperatures and densities in the pedestal region produce significant edge bootstrap current that must be considered in modelling of feedback control of shape and vertical stability. In this paper we present new results of transport simulations fully consistent with the final ITER design that remain within allowed limits for the coil system and power supplies. These self-consistent simulations increase our confidence in meeting the challenges of the ITER program.},

Although this paper focuses on the Lawson criterion, it is only one of many equally important factors in assessing the progress and ultimate likelihood of any fusion concept becoming a commercially viable fusion-energy system. Only experimentally measured or inferred values of n, τ or τE, and T that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature are included in this paper, unless noted otherwise. For extracting these parameters, we discuss methodologies that are necessarily specific to different fusion approaches (including magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion).

A new transport code, SolEdge2D–EIRENE, has been developed with the ability to simulate the plasma up to the ﬁrst wall. This is especially important for steady state operation, where thermal loads on all the plasma facing components, even remote from the plasma, are of interest. Moreover, main chamber tungsten sources are thought to dominate the contamination of the plasma core. We present here in particular new developments aimed at improving the description of the interface between the plasma and the wall, namely a way to treat sheath physics in a more faithful way using the output of 1D particle in cell simulations. Moreover, different models for prompt redeposition have been implemented and are compared. The latter is shown to play an important role in the balance between divertor and main chamber sources.},

Therefore, attention has to be paid to the thermal–hydraulic design of its cooling system. In this work a mathematical model has been developed to investigate the steady state and transient thermal–hydraulic performance of ITER tungsten divertor monoblock. The model predicts the thermal response of the divertor structural materials and coolant tube. The coolant tube is divided into specified axial regions and the divertor plate is divided into specified radial zones, and then a two-dimensional heat conduction calculation is performed to predict the temperature distribution for both steady and transient states. A two-dimensional numerical finite difference technique is adapted in Cartesian coordinate system where the implicit scheme is used for transient calculation. The model also accounts for the melting, vaporization, and re-solidification of the upper layer of the divertor facing plasma. The selected heat transfer correlations cover all possible operating conditions of ITER under both normal and off-normal situations. The model is verified against a previous calculation in the literature for DEMO divertor at an incident surface heat flux of 10 MW/m2. The model is then used to predict the steady state thermal behaviour of the divertor under incident surface heat fluxes ranges from 2 to 20 MW/m2 for a bare cooling tube and cooling tube with swirl-tape insertion. It calculates the maximum tube surface heat flux and the minimum critical heat flux ratio for all cases as well. The model is also used to simulate the divertor materials response subjected to high heat flux during a vertical displacement event (VDE) where 60 MJ/m2 plasma energy is deposited over 500 ms.},

	abstract = {Plasma facing components inside future nuclear fusion reactors are subjected to a high heat load and intense irradiation conditions. Using advanced computational material models, several problems can be solved that reflect tungsten monoblocks under fusion relevant loading scenarios. This allows for the identification of the conditions under which material failure is probable. The material model and parameters are identified such that the mechanical behaviour is in accordance with the homogenized behaviour of a previously developed crystal plasticity model on the microscopic scale. The heterogeneous stress field that follows is analysed in order to assess the probability of material failure, which is typically reflected by unstable crack propagation. Since fracture is an inherently multi-scale problem, critical regions are analysed in detail by means of a representative volume element. The resulting analysis reveals that in case the stress relaxation in the monoblock under the applied static heat load is complete, the probability of unstable crack propagation can reach values close to 35\%. Finally, the impact of prolonged neutron irradiation is simulated by means of a cluster dynamics model. Although irradiation drastically increases the brittleness of tungsten, its impact on the overall monoblock performance remains limited.},

	abstract = {The migration of ﬁrst wall material due to erosion, plasma transport and re-deposition is one of the key challenges in current and future fusion devices. To predict erosion/re-deposition patterns and to understand the underlying principal processes, the global simulation code WallDYN was developed. It couples the evolution of the ﬁrst wall surface composition to plasma impurity transport. To benchmark the WallDYN model, it was applied to the JET ITER-like wall experiment (JET-ILW), which mimics the ITER ﬁrst wall material conﬁguration and is thus an ideal environment to validate the predictive signiﬁcance of WallDYN calculations for ITER application. The WallDYN calculations show good agreement with the Be deposition patterns determined from JET-ILW post-campaign wall tile analysis. The WallDYN results on W erosion and deposition also qualitatively match the post mortem patterns but quantitatively fall short by a factor of 20 which can be consolidated by including the inﬂuence of ELMs on the W erosion source. Applying the same model and process physics as for the JET calculations, the impurity migration and resulting fuel species co-deposition in ITER for different wall conﬁgurations and background plasmas were calculated. The simulations show that C containing wall conﬁgurations lead to unacceptable T retention whereas for the current ITER material choice (Be wall and W divertor) co-deposition will not limit the ITER operation. However the erosion of W by self-sputtering even without the contribution of ELMs could hamper ITER operation under certain plasma scenarios.},

Moreover, an interesting evaluation of the CPU time for the performance of our proposed PFE in this research is employed as well.

Both the near-surface diffusion and recombination of a bulk hydrogen atom with a hydrogen atom adsorbed upon the W(1 1 0) and W(1 0 0) surfaces are investigated at various surface adsorption coverage ratios. This study intends to model the desorption processes occurring during thermal-desorption spectroscopy experiments and the absorption of hydrogen during gaseous or low energy atomic exposure. Since the diffusion and recombination processes are expected to change as the hydrogen coverage of the surface varies, different coverage ratios were investigated on both surfaces. We found that at a saturation coverage of hydrogen on both surfaces, the activation barriers for the recombination of molecular hydrogen are below 0.8 eV. On the contrary, below saturation, the activation barriers for recombination rise to 1.35 eV and 1.51 eV depending on the coverage and on the orientation of the surface. Regarding the absorption of atomic hydrogen from the surface into the bulk, the activation barrier raises from less than 1.0 eV at saturation to around 1.7 eV below saturation on both surfaces. These results indicate that surface mechanisms certainly play a significant role in the kinetics of desorption of hydrogen from tungsten; it is also expected that surface mechanisms affect the total amount on hydrogen absorbed in tungsten during implantation.},

	abstract = {The coadsorption of O and H on a W(110) plane has been studied by thermal desorption, work function and XPS measurements. Attainable coverages depend on adsorption order. For H preadsorption, O coverage decreases linearly from O/W=0.56 at H/W=0 to 0 at H/W=0.95. For O precoverage H decreases nonlinearly, reaching 0 at O/W=0.35. Whether pre- or post-adsorbed, O decreases the peak desorption temperatures of H2 to 400K from their values of 560 to 450K (depending on coverage) for H/W(110). This provides a rough estimate of ΔH for desorption of H2, namely 23kcal/mol at high O coverage and 28kcal/mol of H2 at low O coverage. These values should be compared with ΔH=34kcal/mol of H at low H coverage and 30kcal/mol at high coverage on clean W(110). For O post-adsorption work function increases are similar to those on clean W(110). However, for H post-adsorption complex behavior is seen and differs for O/W(110) layers prepared and kept at 90K and those annealed at 600K, suggesting differences in H binding. The importance of these differences disappears at H2 desorption temperatures, since desorption behavior is independent of adsorption order or surface pretreatment. No evidence for OH or H2O formation under any conditions was found. Sticking coefficients of O on H precovered W(110) decrease linearly with O coverage, instead of showing a plateau as on clean W(110), suggesting that H decreases the lifetime of O2 precursors.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the dissolution, segregation and diffusion of hydrogen (H) in a tungsten (W) grain boundary (GB) using a first-principles method in order to understand the GB trapping mechanism of H. Optimal charge density plays an essential role in such a GB trapping mechanism. Dissolution and segregation of H are directly associated with the optimal charge density, which can be reflected by the H solution and segregation energy sequence for the different interstitial sites. To occupy the optimal-charge-density site, H can be easily trapped by the W GB with the solution and segregation energy of −0.23 eV and −1.11 eV, respectively. Kinetically, such a trapping is easier to realize due to the much lower diffusion barrier of 0.13–0.16 eV from the bulk to the GB in comparison with the segregation energy, suggesting that it is quite difficult for the trapped H to escape out of the GB. However, the GB can hold no more than 2 H atoms because the isosurface of optimal charge density almost disappears with the second H atom in, leading to the conclusion that H2 molecule and thus H bubble cannot form in the W GB. Taking into account the lower vacancy formation energy in the GB as compared with the bulk, we propose that the experimentally observed H bubble formation in the W GB should be via a vacancy trapping mechanism.},

	abstract = {The coupling of ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) power to the plasma depends critically on the scrape-off layer (SOL) density since the fast wave is evanescent below the cut-off density. The ICRF power coupling can be improved by increasing the SOL density locally in front of the antenna by means of local gas puffing/fueling. To understand the influence of local gas puffing on the SOL and ICRF coupling and to find the optimized gas valve positions to maximize ICRF coupling in ITER, the 3D SOL code EMC3-EIRENE is used to calculate the SOL density, and the ICRF antenna codes ANTITER and FELICE are then used to calculate the coupling resistances. Purely deuterium plasma is simulated and the total gas puff rate for all studied cases is 4.5e22 el/s. The divertor gas puffing case is considered as the reference case. The density and temperature profiles in the reference case are well fitted to the standard ITER profiles (both for the low and medium density) with proper transport parameter profiles. The gas source is then switched to other local positions of the main chamber while all other simulation parameters are kept the same. The simulation results indicate that midplane gas puffing increases the antenna coupling resistance most significantly (by 150\%-200\%) for both ICRF antennas. This increase is at the same level as long as the gas valve is located toroidally close to the antenna, no matter if the gas valve is right to or left to the antenna. Outer top gas puffing increases the coupling resistance less significantly (by 100\%–150\%) for the antenna with good magnetic field line connections to the gas valve, but the increase is at a much smaller level (by ∼30\%–60\%) for the other antenna with only partial field line connections to the valve. The simulations thus confirm for ITER a behavior similar as seen experimentally in current devices and strongly suggest that ITER should modify the existing main chamber injection configuration to bring one of the four planned injection points closer to the antennas.},
