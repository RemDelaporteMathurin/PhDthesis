	abstract = {Breeding blankets are designed to ensure tritium self-sufficiency in deuterium–tritium fusion power plants. In addition to this, breeder blankets play a vital role in shielding key components of the reactor, and provide the main source of heat which will ultimately be used to generate electricity. Blanket design is critical to the success of fusion reactors and integral to the design process. Neutronic simulations of breeder blankets are regularly performed to ascertain the performance of a particular design. An iterative process of design improvements and parametric studies are required to optimize the design and meet performance targets. Within the EU DEMO program the breeding blanket design cycle is repeated for each new baseline design. One of the key steps is to create three-dimensional models suitable primarily for use in neutronics, but could be used in other computer-aided design (CAD)-based physics and engineering analyses. This article presents a novel blanket design tool which automates the process of producing heterogeneous 3D CAD-based geometries of the helium-cooled pebble bed, water-cooled lithium lead, helium-cooled lithium lead and dual-coolant lithium lead blanket types. The paper shows a method of integrating neutronics, thermal analysis and mechanical analysis with parametric CAD to facilitate the design process. The blanket design tool described in this paper provides parametric geometry for use in neutronics and engineering simulations. This paper explains the methodology of the design tool and demonstrates use of the design tool by generating all four EU blanket designs using the EU DEMO baseline. Neutronics and heat transfer simulations using the models have been carried out. The approach described has the potential to considerably speed up the design cycle and greatly facilitate the integration of multiphysics studies.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01477426},
	abstract = {During ITER operation, important flux of Hydrogen Isotopes (HIs) constituting the fuel interact with the plasma facing components (PFC) of the machine. In the case of tungsten (W) making the divertor which is the most exposed area to the plasma wall interaction, the incident flux can be implanted and diffuse inside the bulk material inducing a trapping of the fuel. To safety issue, the tritium inventory retained in ITER’s PFC is limited. In addition, the outgassing of the fuel during plasma operation can impact the edge plasma control. The aim of this PhD project is first to determined relevant trapping parameters of the fuel in W (detrapping energies/temperatures and trap concentrations) by modelling experimental results. The simulations of experimental results shows that under specific condition, the HI implantation can induce the formation of mono-vacancies containing impurities. In addition to this induced trap, 2 intrinsic traps are present in W. This 3 traps retain HIs up to 700 K. Finally, it has been shown that the damaged W by heavy ions or neutrons contains dislocations, dislocation loops and cavities that can trap HIs up to 1000 K. After determining the fuel retention properties of W, the HIs retention during ITER operation is estimated. During this operation, the PFC temperature reaches around 1000 K so the simulations show that the damaged W retains much more HIs than the undamaged W.},

	abstract = {Relevant parameters for trapping of Hydrogen Isotopes (HIs) in polycrystalline tungsten are determined with the MHIMS code (Migration of Hydrogen Isotopes in MaterialS) which is used to reproduce Thermal Desorption Spectrometry experiments. Three types of traps are found: two intrinsic traps (detrapping energy of 0.87 eV and 1.00 eV) and one extrinsic trap created by ion irradiation (detrapping energy of 1.50 eV). Then MHIMS is used to simulate HIs retention at different fluences and different implantation temperatures. Simulation results agree well with experimental data. It is shown that at 300 K the retention is limited by diffusion in the bulk. For implantation temperatures above 500 K, the retention is limited by trap creation processes. Above 600 K, the retention drops by two orders of magnitude as compared to the retention at 300 K. With the determined detrapping energies, HIs outgassing at room temperature is predicted. After ions implantation at 300 K, 45\% of the initial retention is lost to vacuum in 300 000 s while during this time the remaining trapped HIs diffuse twice as deep into the bulk.},

Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to evaluate the behavior of hydrogen and helium near a 2-nm bubble or void below a tungsten surface as a function of surface orientation, temperature, gas atom concentration, initial hydrogen distribution, and depth below the surface. A clear tendency for hydrogen to segregate to the bubble-matrix interface is observed in these simulations, regardless of the initial spatial distribution of the hydrogen or simulation parameters. This segregation is due in part to a local minimum in the hydrogen energy at the periphery of the bubble. Further work is required to fully characterize the mechanism of this behavior and to assess the quantities of hydrogen in the bubble and at the bubble periphery.},

	abstract = {We present a comparison between a continuum-scale drift-diffusion-reaction cluster dynamics prediction of helium retention in low-energy helium plasma exposed tungsten and experimental measurements, in a temperature regime that did not produce tungsten fuzz. Our cluster dynamics model, Xolotl, has been successfully benchmarked to high helium implantation flux MD simulations at relatively low implanted fluence. In this article, we also describe the extension of the Xolotl DDR model to incorporate the effect of bubble bursting, which is observed in very high rate MD simulations, as well as MD simulations at longer times than simulated in our prior benchmarking comparison. The bursting model parameters have been tuned by comparing to MD simulations at a flux of 5.0 × 1027 m−2 s−1, and also compared to lower implanted fluence simulations performed at 4.0 × 1025 m−2 s−1. This article then reports on the consistency of the Xolotl predictions with respect to the size of the simulated cluster phase space (i.e. the maximum cluster size), initial vacancy concentration, and bubble growth trajectory (maximum number of helium atoms per vacancy). Finally, our simulation results are compared to helium plasma experiments that did not produce fuzz. While the Xolotl predictions including bubble bursting are in quantitative agreement with high-flux MD simulations, the initial comparison to plasma exposure experiments at a flux on the order of 1021 m−2 s−1 disagree by more than an order of magnitude, and in fact cannot reproduce the trends in helium retention with varying exposure temperature. Modifying the initial vacancy concentrations and helium cluster diffusion behavior in Xolotl leads to a reasonable agreement with the experimental observations, although the underlying physical explanation for these modifications remains unclear. The predicted helium content at experimentally relevant fluxes has been shown to be relatively insensitive to the parameters used in the bubble bursting model implemented in Xolotl, although these parameters have a larger influence at higher flux. More systematic comparisons between the modeling predictions with both experiments and MD simulation results is expected to improve the bubble bursting model in Xolotl in the future.},

The influence of a-priori known thermal field has also been included. To ensure the solution convergence and the numerical stability, the trapping kinetic is introduced by using an approximation of the analytical solution the McNabb and Foster equation. Comparisons with a relevant 1D MRE code and with thermal programmed desorption (TPD) experimental results are performed on a 1D configuration to validate the model. Next, the model is used to simulate the tritium diffusion and trapping in a 2D geometry of interest in the upper plug of ITER tokamak, and results of tritium inventory are compared with an equivalent 1D calculation.},

The flux of implanted helium atoms studied, Γ ≈ 4 × 1025 m−2 s−1, is about one order of magnitude larger than that expected in ITER, the experimental fusion reactor currently being constructed in France. With simulation times on the order of 1 μs, these results serve to discover the mechanisms involved in surface evolution as well as to serve as benchmarks for coarse-grained simulations such as kinetic Monte Carlo and continuum-scale drift–reaction–diffusion cluster dynamics simulations. The findings of our large-scale simulations are significant due to diminished finite-size effects and the longer times reached (corresponding to higher fluences). Specifically, our findings are drastically different from findings published previously in the literature for (001) surfaces under a helium flux of Γ ∼ 1028 m−2 s−1, which is typical of smaller size and shorter time atomistic simulations. In particular, this study highlights the atomic-scale materials processes relevant to helium entrapment and transport in metals, which have implications not only for nuclear fusion–relevant processes, but also helium-induced embrittlement in irradiated materials such as hospital equipment and fission reactor materials.},

Two grades of materials are considered to be exposed to tritium ions: an undamaged W and a damaged W exposed to fast fusion neutrons. Due to strong temperature gradient in the PFC, Soret effect’s impacts on tritium retention is also evaluated for both cases. Thanks to the simulation, the evolutions of the tritium retention and the tritium migration depth are obtained as a function of the implanted flux and the number of cycles. From these evolutions, extrapolation laws are built to estimate the number of cycles needed for tritium to permeate from the implantation zone to the cooled surface and to quantify the corresponding retention of tritium throughout the W PFC.},

A pulsed Laser-Induced Desorption (LID) system, called Tritium Monitor, is being designed to locally measure the T-retention in co-deposits forming on the inner divertor baffle of ITER. Regarding tritium removal, the baseline strategy is to perform baking of the plasma-facing components, at 513K for the FW and 623K for the divertor. Both baking and laser desorption rely on the thermal desorption of tritium from the surface, the efficiency of which remains unclear for thick (and possibly impure) co-deposits.

The peak temperature reached during an ELM-like plasma pulse increased by a factor 1.45 over the 100 s of He plasma exposure, indicating a deterioration of the thermal properties. Transient loading experiments were also performed using a high power pulsed laser during He plasma exposure, showing a significant modification of the target thermal response caused by the surface damage.

In this work, we measured thermal conductivity of tungsten (W) surface layers damaged by He plasma in PISCES at UCSD. We studied the damage effect on both bulk, and thin film, W. We observed that the surface morphology of both bulk and thin film was altered after exposure to He plasma with the fluence of 1 × 1026 m−2 (bulk) and 2 × 1024 m−2 (thin film). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that the depth of the irradiation damaged layer was approximately 20 nm on the bulk W exposed to He plasma at 773 K for 2000 s. In order to measure the thermal conductivity of this exceedingly thin damaged layer in the bulk W, we adopted the well-established ‘3-omega’ method and employed novel nanofabrication techniques to improve the measurement sensitivity. For the damaged W thin film sample, we measured the reduction in electrical conductivity and used the Wiedemann-Franz (W-F) law to extract the thermal conductivity. Results from both measurements show that thermal conductivity in the damaged layers was reduced by at least ∼80\% compared to that of undamaged W. This large reduction in thermal conductivity can be attributed to the scattering of electrons, the dominant heat carriers in W, caused by defects introduced by He plasma irradiation.},

A damaged layer of 10 nm thickness was formed on the sample surface with a destroyed crystalline structure. Helium-bubbles and surface modification in nanoscale were observed. Thermal conductivities of the ultra-thin damaged layers were measured by the transient thermoreflectance technique. Result shows that the thermal conductivity reduced two orders of magnitude compared to the bulk value and decreased with increasing irradiation temperature and fluence. Moreover, the helium-irradiated samples were exposed to ELM-like heat load produced by electron beam on EMS-60. The pulse length was 1 ms and each sample was exposed to 5 pulses. Melting occurred under power density of 1.7 GW m−2. As the thermal conductivity of the damaged layer decreased, the molten bath of the irradiated sample deepened. The degraded thermal conductivity led to a lower melting threshold.

Tungsten produced according to the ITER material specifications by Plansee SE, Austria, was loaded sequentially and simultaneously by steady-state He plasma and transient thermal loads induced by a laser beam. All tungsten samples were exposed to helium plasma for 40min at a base temperature of ca. 850°C and a flux of ca. 2.8×1022m−2s−1. Before, during and after the plasma exposure 1000 thermal shock pulses with a pulse duration of 1ms and a power density 0.76GW/m² were applied on the samples. The thermal shock exposure before and after plasma exposure was done at room temperature in order to investigate helium induced surface effects also within cracks. The obtained results show that the combination of He plasma with transient thermal shock events results in a severe modification such as reduced height or agglomeration of the sub-surface He-bubbles and of the created nanostructures, i.e. W-fuzz.},

The surface-energy barriers for both temperatures are determined analytically with a steady-state analysis. The desorption energy per D atom from the surface is 0.69 ± 0.02 eV at 500 K and 0.87 ± 0.03 eV at 600 K. These values are in good agreement with ab initio calculations as well as experimental determination of desorption energies. The absorption energy (from the surface to the bulk) is 1.33 ± 0.04 eV at 500 K, 1.55 ± 0.02 eV at 600 K when assuming that the resurfacing energy (from the bulk to the surface) is 0.2 eV. Thermal-desorption spectrometry data after D atom exposure at 500 K and isothermal desorption at 600 K after D atom exposure at 600 K can be reproduced quantitatively with three bulk-detrapping energies, namely 1.65 ± 0.01 eV, 1.85 ± 0.03 eV and 2.06 ± 0.04 eV, in addition to the intrinsic detrapping energies known for undamaged tungsten (0.85 eV and 1.00 eV). Thanks to analyses of the amount of traps during annealing at different temperatures and ab initio calculations, the 1.65 eV detrapping energy is attributed to jogged dislocations and the 1.85 eV detrapping energy is attributed to dislocation loops. Finally, the 2.06 eV detrapping energy is attributed to D trapping in cavities based on literature reporting observations on the growth of cavities, even though this could also be understood as D desorbing from the C-D bond in the case of hydrocarbon contamination in the experimental sample.},

Special attention has been given on the investigation of D retention in thin films of tungsten carbide and tungsten oxide which can be formed on W surface in a fusion device. Such kinds of films increase the D retention in W. Several points are reviewed: (i) inventory in pure W, (ii) inventory in W pre-implanted by carbon ions and (iii) inventory in tungsten oxide.},

	abstract = {First a brief introduction to hydrogen bubbles in metals and their technological importance is presented. The review concentrates on those areas of bubble formation where the distinct chemical character of hydrogen is important. A distinction is made between nucleation and subsequent cavity growth mechanisms. Both homogeneous and heterogenous nucleation are given as possibilities. Three cavity growth mechanisms are delineated: plastic deformation near a surface referred to as “blistering”, plastic deformation by loop punching, and the collection of vacancy-hydrogen complexes. Several factors are considered which can determine the particular mechanism which applies, such as the source of the hydrogen and its concentration, solubility and diffusivity and the concentration of defects in the metal. A preemptive reaction to bubble formation is the one leading to metal hydride formation. This reaction must be considered both for predicting the formation of bubbles and for experimental observations. The possibility of plastic deformation near a free surface can lead to blistering, and this must be considered. The current understanding of loop punching processes is presented and applied to hydrogen bubble formation. Vacancy clustering may also lead to void formation which may then absorb further hydrogen-vacancy complexes. Illustrative examples of hydrogen filled cavities in selected metals and alloys are discussed in detail.},

Incident D3+ ions were implanted to fluences of 1021, 1022, and 1023 D+/m2 with ion energies (500 eV/D+) below the threshold energy for elastic collision damage. Above 3×1018 D+/m2s, little or no flux dependence is seen. However, a rapid decrease in retention is seen for incident fluxes below 1018 D+/m2s at the 1021 D+/m2 fluence, suggesting a threshold value below which retention is strongly reduced. Flux dependence at the higher fluences show a smaller decrease in retention with decreasing flux. The observed results are consistent with trapping and trap evolution by cluster and cavity formation. The effect of specimen surface preparation has proved to be very significant, especially for the lower fluence.},

To estimate trapping energy of trap sites in this damaged W, TMAP simulation was performed. The result shows that the trapping energy of 1.29eV well accounted for the result of 250 °C annealing. In view that in the literature the vacancy trapping energy of hydrogen in tungsten was estimated to be close to 1.43 eV and the sensitivity analysis has given an uncertainty for the trapping energy of the order of 0.1 eV, it appears that the dominant trapping site type in the investigated damaged tungsten consists of vacancies.},

	abstract = {Leading edges of the ITER tungsten (W) divertor are expected to melt due to transient heat loads from edge localized modes (ELMs), and melting of the entire divertor surface will occur during vertical displacement events (VDEs) and disruptions. In addition, understanding tritium retention in plasma facing materials is critical for the successful operation of ITER due to safety reasons. Thus, the question of how melting affects hydrogenic retention is highly relevant for fusion devices. Here we use an Nd:YAG laser to melt tungsten and beryllium in vacuo, and the samples are subsequently exposed to deuterium plasma with sample temperatures ranging from 370 to 750 K. The deuterium content in re-solidified and reference (no laser) samples is measured using thermal desorption spectroscopy and modeled using TMAP-7. In all cases, the re-solidified samples have lower retention compared to the reference samples. For re-solidified tungsten, the most significant effect is in the 1.8 eV trap with peak thermal desorption temperature of ∼750 K, which had a 77\% reduction in the peak release rate compared with the reference sample. SEM imaging indicates that laser melting and re-solidification of tungsten anneals intrinsic defects that act as nucleation sites for larger-scale defects that develop during plasma exposure. However, melting does not significantly affect traps with lower de-trapping energies of 1.0 eV and 1.4 eV. In beryllium, melting and cracking results in lower retention compared to the reference sample by 40\%, and thermal desorption profiles indicate that the diffusion depth of deuterium into re-solidified beryllium is lower than that of the reference sample.},

Currently, more than 700 scientific citations are made to SRIM every year. For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the SRIM package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 27,000 experimental data points.

Based on this, we predicted the critical H concentration for H bubble formation at different temperatures. The critical concentration, defined as the value when the concentration of H at a certain mH-vacancy complex first became equal to that of H at the interstitial, was 24 ppm/7.3 GPa and 410 ppm/4.7 GPa at 600 K in tungsten and molybdenum in the case of a monovacancy. Beyond the critical H concentration, numerous H atoms accumulated in the monovacancy, leading to the formation and rapid growth of H-vacancy complexes, which was considered the preliminary stage of H bubble formation. We expect that the proposed approach will be generally used to determine the critical H concentration for H bubble formation in metals.},

This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},

The present calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) reveal unusual phenomena predicted at a super-saturated hydrogen concentration: (1) strongly enhanced vacancy concentration with the super-saturated hydrogen concentration is predicted by a thermodynamics model assuming multiple-hydrogen trapping, i.e. hydrogen clusters formation, in the vacancies; and (2) DFT molecular dynamics revealed that hydrogen clusters can prevent a vacancy from recombining with the neighboring crowdion-type self-interstitial-atom. This suggests that neutron damage effects will be increased in the presence of the hydrogen clusters.},

The subsurface hydrogen concentration is calculated given a flux of hydrogen, a temperature of implantation, and the energy of the incoming hydrogen ions as independent variables. This global model is built step by step; an equilibrium between atomic hydrogen within bulk tungsten and a molecular hydrogen gas phase is first considered, and the calculated solubility is compared with experimental results. Subsequently, a kinetic model is used to determine the chemical potential for hydrogen in the subsurface of tungsten. Combining both these models, two regimes are established in which hydrogen is preferentially trapped either at interstitial sites or in vacancies. We deduce from our model that the existence of these two regimes is driven by the temperature of the implanted tungsten sample; above a threshold or transition temperature is the interstitial regime, and below is the vacancy regime in which supersaturated layers form within tenths of an angstrom below the surface. A simple analytical expression is derived for the coexistence of the two regimes depending on the implantation temperature, the incident energy, and the flux of the hydrogen ions which we use to plot the corresponding phase diagram.},

The best fits are obtained with two intrinsic trap types, deep and shallow, and an extrinsic trap created by plasma irradiation and plastic deformation of the tungsten matrix associated with blister formation. We then consider a realistic cycle of plasma discharges consisting of 400s of plasma exposure followed by a resting period of 1000s, repeating for several hours.

In previous papers, it has been shown that plasma facing components are prone to crack, appearing in tungsten block during thermal cyclic heat loading. In order to predict component lifetime, a numerical simulation is proposed in this paper. With regard to previous studies, tungsten (raw and recrystallized) real mechanical behaviors are taken into account. To be used as inputs for numerical simulations, compressive tests at different temperatures and strain rates were realized on raw and recrystallized tungsten. Raw tungsten tests reveal a linear elastic and ideal plastic behavior that is sensitive to strain rate. Concerning recrystallized tungsten, an elastic-viscoplastic behavior is observed on the entire explored temperature range (up to 1150 °C), that can be described by an elastic-plastic model with kinematic hardening. Manson-Coffin relationships are used to estimate the lifetime. When taking into account real mechanical behaviors for raw tungsten and recrystallized tungsten, we show that lifetime estimation is mainly driven by recrystallized thickness in the component, by the ductile to brittle transition temperature and finally by strain rate.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is a leading candidate material for the diverter in future nuclear fusion reactors. Previous experiments have demonstrated that surface defects and bubbles form in tungsten when ex- posed to helium and hydrogen plasmas, even at modest ion energies. In some regimes, between 1000K and 2000K, and for He energies below 100eV, "fuzz" like features form. The mechanisms leading to these surfaces comprised of nanometer sized tungsten tendrils which include visible helium bubbles are not currently known. The role of helium bubble formation in tendril morphology could very likely be the starting point of these mechanisms. Using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of helium and hydrogen exposure in the initial formation mechanisms of tungsten "fuzz" are investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations are well suited to describe the time and length scales associated with initial formation of helium clusters that eventually grow to nano-meter sized helium bubbles. MD simulations also easily enable the modeling of a variety of surfaces such as single crystals, grain boundaries or "tendrils".While the sputtering yield of tungsten is generally low, previous observations of surface modification due to plasma exposure raise questions about the effects of surface morphology and sub-surface helium bubble populations on the sputtering behavior. Results of computational molecular dynamics are reported that investigate the influence of sub-surface helium bubble distributions on the sputtering yield of tungsten (100) and (110) surfaces induced by helium ion exposure in the range of 300 eV to 1 keV. The calculated sputtering yields are in reasonable agreement with a wide range of experimental data; but do not show any significant variation as a result of the pre-existing helium bubbles.Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a number of sub-surface mechanisms leading to nanometer- sized "fuzz" in tungsten exposed to low-energy helium plasmas. We find that during the bubble formation process, helium clusters create self-interstitial defect clusters in tungsten by a trap mutation process, followed by the migration of these defects to the surface that leads to the formation of layers of adatom islands on the tungsten surface. As the helium clusters grow into nanometer sized bubbles, their proximity to the surface and extremely high gas pressures can cause them to rupture the surface thus enabling helium release. Helium bubble bursting induces additional surface damage and tungsten mass loss which varies depending on the nature of the surface. We then show tendril-like geometries have surfaces that are more resilient to helium clustering and bubble formation and rupture. Finally, the study includes hydrogen to reveal the effect of a mixed 90\%H-10\%He plasma mix on the tungsten surface. We find that hydrogen greatly affects the tungsten surface, with a near surface hydrogen saturation layer, and that helium clusters still form and are attractive trapping sites for hydrogen.Molecular dynamics simulations have also investigated the effect of sub-surface helium bubble evolution on tungsten surface morphology. The helium bubble/tungsten surface interaction has been systematically studied to determine how parameters such as bubble shape and size, temperature, tungsten surface orientation and ligament thickness above the bubble impact bubble stability and surface evolution. The tungsten surface is roughened by a combination of adatom islands, craters and pinholes. The study provides insight into the mechanisms and conditions leading to various tungsten topology changes, most notably the formation of nanoscale fuzz.An atomistic study of the mechanisms behind initial phases of tungsten nano-fuzz growth has determined that tungsten surfaces are affected by sub-displacement energy helium and hydrogen fluxes through a series of mechanisms. Sub-surface helium atom clustering, bubble nucleation, growth and rupture lead to tungsten surface deformation. Helium clustering processes vary near grain boundaries or in tendril-like surface geometries. In the presence of hydrogen, these mechanisms are coupled with hydrogen surface saturation. Finally, further investigation to connect these atomistic mechanisms to nano-size tungsten fuzz growth is needed to get a comprehensive under- standing of the effects of low energy helium and hydrogen on tungsten.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the dynamics of helium clustering behaviour within either a nanometer-sized tendril of fuzz, or a half-space domain, as predicted by a reaction–diffusion model. This analysis has identified a dimensionless parameter, PΔ, which is a balance of the reaction and diffusion actions of insoluble He in a metal matrix and which governs the self-trapping effects of He into growing bubbles within a tendril. The impact of He self-trapping, as well as trapping caused by pre-existing traps in the form of lattice defects or clusters of impurities, within a half-space domain results in the formation of a densely packed layer of nanometer-sized bubbles with high number density. This prediction is consistent with available experimental observations in which a dense zone of helium bubbles is observed in tungsten, which are compared to estimates of the layer characteristics. Direct numerical simulation of the reaction–diffusion cluster dynamics supports the analysis presented here.},

Density Functional Theory (DFT) atomistic calculations [1] were used to obtain the properties of He and He-vacancy clusters, and the Binary Collision Approximation based code MARLOWE was applied to determine the damage and He-ion depth profiles as in [2], [3]. The processes involved in the homogeneous He bubble nucleation and growth were defined and implemented in the Object Kinetic Monte Carlo code LAKIMOCA [4]. In particular as the He to dpa ratio was high, self-trapping of He clusters and the trap mutation of He-vacancy clusters had to be taken into account. With this multiscale approach, the formation of bubbles was modeled up to nanometer-scale size, where bubbles can be observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Their densities and sizes were studied as functions of fluence (up to 5×1019He/m2) at two temperatures (473 and 723K) and for different sample thicknesses (25–250nm). It appears that the damage is not only due to the collision cascades but is also strongly controlled by the He accumulation in pressurized bubbles.

The simulations span two orders of magnitude, from ITER-relevant levels to those more typical of simulations published to date. Simulation times of up to 2.5 µs (corresponding to actual fluences of m−2) are achieved, revealing concerted bubble-bursting events that are responsible for significant and very sudden changes in surface morphology. The depth distribution of helium depends very strongly on helium flux: helium self-trapping becomes more probable near the surface at high flux, and a layer of near-surface bubbles forms. Helium retention prior to the onset of bubble bursting is also substantially lower at low flux than it is at high flux. Surface features at low fluence are correlated with the positions of bubbles, but at high fluence, bubbles tend to coalesce, venting to the surface at one or more locations and leaving large interconnected cavities below the surface. Ruptured bubbles may serve as pathways deeper into the material, allowing helium to bypass the layer of near-surface bubbles and fill deeper, potentially much larger, bubbles that can produce more substantial surface features. Deeper bubbles also emit prismatic dislocation loops that can fill in cavities closer to the surface. Our results suggest that nearly all molecular dynamics simulations published to date are hampered by finite-size effects, and that helium flux is a very important parameter in determining the behavior of helium in plasma-facing components.},

After a short discussion suggestive of a heuristic model for predicting the associated energy and the heat of transport, data from several experiments are analyzed to show that the simplistic model works reasonably well with endothermic materials such as Fe and Ni, but is less successful with hydride formers. The implications of the model for tritium permeation and retention are discussed, and sample calculations are presented to illustrate the importance of properly accounting for the Soret effect in predicting tritium permeation and retention in fusion reactor structures. Neglecting the Soret effect may result in order of magnitude errors in estimating permeation and retention, while accounting for temperature sensitivity in the heat of transport will result in less significant corrections. An Appendix summarizes the development of transport equations from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to clarify the relationships between the various transport parameters involved.},

FESTIM has been validated by reproducing experimental data and the Method of Manufactured Solutions was used for analytical verification. Following relevant plasma scenarios, both transient heat transfer and hydrogen isotopes (HIs) diffusion have been simulated in order to assess HIs retention in monoblocks. Relevant materials properties have been used. Each plasma cycle is composed of a current ramp up, a current plateau, a current ramp down and a resting phase before the following shot. 100 cycles are simulated. The total HIs inventory in the tokamak during resting phases reaches 1.8×10−3mg whereas during the implantation phases it keeps increasing as a power law of time. Particle flux on the cooling channel of the monoblock is also computed. The breakthrough time is estimated to be t=1×105s which corresponds to 24 cycles. Relevance of 2D modelling has been demonstrated by comparing the total HIs inventory obtained by 2D and 1D simulations. Using 1D simulations, a relative error is observed compared to 2D simulations which can reach -25\% during the resting phase. The error during implantation phases keeps increasing.},

B 430 (2018) 23–30] has been updated to handle multiple hydrogen species to simulate hydrogen/deuterium isotope-exchange experiments performed on polycrystalline beryllium samples under ultra-high vacuum laboratory conditions. In the experiments subsequent exposures of a sample to hydrogen and deuterium ion beams in direct and reverse implantation order were followed by thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements under a constant heating rate of 0.7 K/s. The recorded signals of masses 2 to 4 (H2, HD and D2) indicate that the second implanted isotope dominates clearly the low temperature release stage ( ≈ 450 K), while both isotopes show a comparable contribution to the high temperature desorption stage ( ≈ 700 K) with only minor effect of the implantation order attributed to a slightly deeper penetration of deuterium compared to hydrogen. Simulations of the implantation and subsequent thermal desorption of hydrogen isotopes are performed to assess the atomic processes behind the isotope-exchange. Simulations were performed under the assumption that the low temperature release stage is attributed to hydrogen/deuterium atoms retained on effective open surfaces (e.g. interconnected porosity) represented in the simulations by a surface with an effective surface area exceeding the nominal exposed surface area by a factor up to 100. Kinetic de-trapping from vacancies with multiple trapping levels and enhanced desorption at surface coverages close to saturation are addressed in the model as possible mechanisms promoting the isotope-exchange. Simulation results suggest the applicability of the model to describe isotope-exchange processes in crystalline beryllium and give a qualitative explanation of the observed experimental facts.},

In targets with reduced inventory, nuclear-reaction analysis reveals shallow D trapping ({\textless}50 nm), in the same locale as nanometre-sized bubbles observed using transmission electron microscopy.

Helium was implanted 1 µm deep into W to a maximum calculated concentration of 3.4 at.\%. To minimize the influence of displacement damage created during the He implantation on D retention, so-called self-damaged W was used. W was damaged by 20 MeV W ion bombardment and defects were populated by low-temperature D plasma at room temperature before He implantation. Deuterium depth profiling was performed in situ during isochronal annealing in the temperature range from 300 K to 800 K. It is shown for the first time unambiguously that He attracts D and locally increases D trapping. Deuterium retention increased by a factor of two as compared to a non-He implanted W reference after sample annealing at 450 K. Rate equation modelling can explain the measured D depth profiles quantitatively when keeping the de-trapping parameters unchanged but only increasing the number of traps in the He zone. This bolsters the confidence in the theoretical calculations predicting that more hydrogen isotopes can be stored around a He cluster zone.},

	abstract = {An in-depth understanding of the formation of intergranular helium bubbles and its relation to embrittlement is an important issue in the nuclear industry. In this paper, a thermodynamic model is developed to analyze the nucleation of intergranular helium bubbles. Microstructural observation using scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction gives a detailed description for the relation between the bubble formation and the grain-boundary (GB) misorientation in helium-implanted nickel and Inconel X750. The theoretical and the experimental results confirm that the nucleation of intergranular helium bubbles is GB structure-dependent, the helium-to-vacancy ratio plays an important role in the bubble precipitation, and the interfacial tension of bubbles cannot be approximated to be the interfacial energy. The bubble-induced intergranular embrittlement in a polycrystal is modelled. The GB misorientation distribution, the intergranular bubble nucleation and growth and the GB connectivity are the key factors affecting the GB fracture toughness. The hoop ductility of the cladding tubes containing helium is analyzed. The hoop stress-induced increase in the GB energy promotes the precipitation of bubbles at the radial GBs and lead to the loss of tube ductility. Based on this work, the complicated correlation among the intergranular helium bubbles, the GB structure, the helium concentration, the applied stress and the helium embrittlement is clarified.},

	abstract = {Palladium can readily dissociate molecular hydrogen at its surface, and rapidly accept it onto the octahedral sites of its face-centered cubic crystal structure. This can include radioactive tritium. As tritium β-decays with a half-life of 12.3 years, He-3 is generated in the metal lattice, causing significant degradation of the material. Helium bubble evolution at high concentrations can result in blister formation or exfoliation and must therefore be well understood to predict the longevity of materials that absorb tritium. A hydrogen over-pressure must be applied to palladium hydride to prevent hydrogen from desorbing from the metal, making it difficult to study tritium in palladium by methods that involve vacuum, such as electron microscopy. Recent improvements in in-situ ion implantation Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) allow for the direct observation of He bubble nucleation and growth in materials. In this work, we present results from preliminary experiments using the new ion implantation Environmental TEM (ETEM) at the University of Huddersfield to observe He bubble nucleation and growth, in-situ, in palladium at cryogenic temperatures in a hydrogen environment. After the initial nucleation phase, bubble diameter remained constant throughout the implantation, but bubble density increased with implantation time. β-phase palladium hydride was not observed to form during the experiments, likely indicating that the cryogenic implantation temperature played a dominating role in the bubble nucleation and growth behavior.},

This paper reports on laboratory-scale studies with 3 keV D+3 ion beams to investigate the hydrogen transport behavior in tungsten coatings on substrates of copper. These experiments entailed measurements of the deuterium re-emission and permeation rates for tungsten, copper, and tungsten-coated copper specimens at temperatures ranging from 638 to 825 K and implanting particle fluxes of approximately 5 × 1019 D/m2 s. Diffusion constants and surface recombination coefficients with enhancement factors due to sputtering were obtained from these measurements.

The cases of laser-only, sequential laser and hydrogen (H) plasma and simultaneous laser plus H plasma exposure are studied. H plasma exposure leads to an embrittlement of the material and the appearance of a crack network originating from the centre of the laser spot. Under simultaneous loading, significant surface melting is observed. In general, H plasma exposure lowers the heat flux parameter (FHF) for the onset of surface melting by ∼25\%. In the case of He-modified (fuzzy) surfaces, strong surface deformations are observed already after 1000 laser pulses at moderate FHF=19MJm−2s−1/2, and a dense network of fine cracks is observed. These results indicate that high-fluence ITER-like plasma exposure influences the thermal shock properties of tungsten, lowering the permissible transient energy density beyond which macroscopic surface modifications begin to occur.},

	abstract = {The effect of deuterium (D) presence on the amount of displacement damage created in tungsten (W) during high-energy W-ion irradiation is investigated. For this purpose, we have performed modelling of experimental results where W was sequentially or simultaneously irradiated by 10.8 MeV W ions and exposed to 300 eV D ions. A novel displacement damage creation and stabilization model was newly developed and introduced into the MHIMS-Reservoir (migration of hydrogen isotopes in materials) code. It employs macroscopic rate equations (MREs) for solving the evolution of solute and trapped D concentrations in the material. The new displacement damage creation and stabilization model is based on spontaneous recombination of Frenkel pairs and stabilization of defects that are occupied by D atoms. By using the new model, we could successfully replicate the measured D depth profiles and D thermal desorption data, where a higher defect concentration was observed when D was present during W irradiation as compared to when no D was present. For this we utilized parameters, which include the number of distinct defect types, the de-trapping energies of their fill-levels, their saturation concentrations and their probability for stabilization if they contain a D during the W-ion irradiation. To successfully replicate the experimental results three distinct defect types were needed with several fill-levels. By comparing the de-trapping energies of the defect fill-levels with data available from the literature, the defect types were identified as single-vacancies, small vacancy clusters and large vacancy clusters. The effect of D presence was found to be largest in single vacancies as its concentration increased by about a factor of three, while the concentration of small vacancy clusters increased by about a factor of two. Large vacancy clusters were found to be largely unaffected as they showed very little increase in concentration when D was present.},

	abstract = {We report a hierarchical multi-scale modeling study of implanted helium segregation on surfaces of tungsten, considered as a plasma facing component in nuclear fusion reactors. We employ a hierarchy of atomic-scale simulations based on a reliable interatomic interaction potential, including molecular-statics simulations to understand the origin of helium surface segregation, targeted molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of near-surface cluster reactions, and large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten. We find that small, mobile He n (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in the near-surface region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. This elastic interaction force induces drift fluxes of these mobile He n clusters, which increase substantially as the migrating clusters approach the surface, facilitating helium segregation on the surface. Moreover, the clusters’ drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions, most importantly trap mutation, in the near-surface region at rates much higher than in the bulk material. These near-surface cluster dynamics have significant effects on the surface morphology, near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure. We integrate the findings of such atomic-scale simulations into a properly parameterized and validated spatially dependent, continuum-scale reaction-diffusion cluster dynamics model, capable of predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. This cluster-dynamics model sets the stage for development of fully atomistically informed coarse-grained models for computationally efficient simulation predictions of helium surface segregation, as well as helium retention and surface morphological evolution, toward optimal design of plasma facing components.},

In this system, fuzzy tungsten was grown over a range of helium ion fluences, , sample temperatures and helium ion energies, but with operator control over the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio at the sample (from 0.003 to 0.009). In the presence of tungsten deposition, it appears that the fuzz growth has two distinct stages: at low to intermediate helium ion fluence the fuzzy layer thickness follows the expected diffusive law augmented by approximately the ‘effective’ thin film thickness of deposited tungsten; at high fluences the fuzz thickness increases very steeply with . These observations are explained through the increase in the porosity of the fuzzy layer as it reaches thicknesses larger than ∼1 m. It was observed that during the second phase of fuzz growth the thickness was highly dependent on both the sample temperature and the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio. For the same helium ion exposure, an increase in the sample temperature from 1050 to 1150 K lead to a six-fold increase in the fuzzy layer thickness, whilst increasing the tungsten atom-to-helium ion arrival rate ratio over the full range produced a two-fold increase in the thickness.

	abstract = {The effects of helium (He)-vacancy clusters on the stress-strain behavior of polycrystalline iron (α-Fe) are investigated by a mechanistic finite element (FE) approach using a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) description of the material behavior informed by molecular dynamics (MD) data. First, MD analyses of a single crystal (loading normal to \{332\} plane) and a bicrystal system containing a Σ11{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{332\} grain boundary (GB) were performed to compute the uniaxial tensile response of an Fe single crystal and a system with a GB. MD results were then used in FE analyses of the same systems to identify parameters for the CDM constitutive relations for the crystal and the traction-separation law for the GB depicted by cohesive elements. Next, a 3D FE model of an α-Fe bicrystal system with an imperfect GB subjected to uniaxial tensile loading was developed. This model includes an equivalent hollow sphere under internal pressure in the middle of the GB to model the effects of pressurized He bubbles at 5 K, room temperature (RT) and 600 K on stress, strain and damage distributions. The radius of the equivalent sphere was determined assuming the presence of two vacancies in the system. Finally, MD stress/strain data of the same bicrystal system with He-vacancy clusters were compared to the corresponding FE results to validate this mechanistic approach that appears to be efficient in terms of computational time. FE model predictions of system strength and fracture strain are in fairly good agreement with the MD results at all three temperatures. Our results show that small and highly pressurized He-vacancy clusters reduce GB strength and fracture strain more significantly at 5 K than at RT and 600 K.},

In this study, He irradiations in the NAGDIS-II linear plasma device, at temperatures below recrystallization and low energies (50 eV) followed by annealing at 1470 K were carried out. Additionally, high energy (28 keV) hydrogen (H) with an admixture of 6 at\% He irradiations in the neutral beam facility GLADIS were performed at temperatures above recrystallization (1770 K). These are compared to pure H irradiations under the same conditions. In the low temperature cases, following irradiation, an undulating microstructure is observed on the surface of the samples after irradiation. After annealing at 1470 K, it is observed that the inhibition effect of He irradiation is more pronounced following lower temperature exposures. The effect of He irradiation on inhibition of recrystallization with grain growth is also observed to saturate at the highest fluences. In the high temperature, high energy case, He irradiation and recrystallization happens simultaneously. Following the irradiation a coral like microstructure is observed on the surface of the sample. The introduction of He is not seen to have a significant effect on the recrystallization process of W when the irradiation is carried out at temperatures above recrystallization.},

	abstract = {An extension of the SolEdge2D-EIRENE code package, named D-WEE, has been developed to add the dynamics of thermal desorption of hydrogen isotopes from the surface of plasma facing materials. To achieve this purpose, D-WEE models hydrogen isotopes implantation, transport and retention in those materials. Before launching auto-consistent simulation (with feedback of D-WEE on SolEdge2D-EIRENE), D-WEE has to be initialised to ensure a realistic wall behaviour in terms of dynamics (pumping or fuelling areas) and fuel content. A methodology based on modelling is introduced to perform such initialisation. A synthetic plasma pulse is built from consecutive SolEdge2D-EIRENE simulations. This synthetic pulse is used as a plasma background for the D-WEE module. A sequence of plasma pulses is simulated with D-WEE to model a tokamak operation. This simulation enables to extract at a desired time during a pulse the local fuel inventory and the local desorption flux density which could be used as initial condition for coupled plasma-wall simulations. To assess the relevance of the dynamic retention behaviour obtained in the simulation, a confrontation to post-pulse experimental pressure measurement is performed. Such confrontation reveals a qualitative agreement between the temporal pressure drop obtained in the simulation and the one observed experimentally. The simulated dynamic retention during the consecutive pulses is also studied.},

Two different Ne seeded plasma backgrounds with varying sub-divertor neutral pressures but the same Ne impurity concentration are considered, representing high recycling and partially detached divertor solutions. The 2D SOLPS numerical grid does not extend all the way to the wall surfaces so that an extrapolation of the plasma background is required and is performed using a second simulation stage in which the far scrape-off layer (SOL) region is numerically gridded and plasma transport solved on the extended grid using the OSM (a 1D simplified Braginski code) approach [1]. The plasma conditions chosen for this far SOL region strongly influence the results. The hydrogenic flux is calculated from the electronic density and ion flow, the latter of which has an assumed distribution. Depending on the main-SOL plasma flow parameters and far-SOL density, fuel retention is driven by deposition on the first wall (when parallel flow through the main-SOL is switched off), or by deposition on the divertor (parallel flow through the main-SOL is switched on). When retention is dominated by deposition on the first wall, there is slightly more retention in the partially detached case compared to a high recycling scenario. In the low power cases, there is insignificant deposition and fuel retention.},

	abstract = {The tungsten (W) material in the high heat flux regions of the ITER divertor will be exposed to high fluxes of low-energy particles (e.g. H, D, T, He, Ne and/or N). Combined with long-pulse operations, this implies fluences well in excess of the highest values reached in today’s tokamak experiments. Shaping of the individual monoblock top surface and tilting of the vertical targets for leading-edge protection lead to an increased surface heat flux, and thus increased surface temperature and a reduced margin to remain below the temperature at which recrystallization and grain growth begin. Significant morphology changes are known to occur on W after exposure to high fluences of low-energy particles, be it H or He. An analysis of the formation conditions of these morphology changes is made in relation to the conditions expected at the vertical targets during different phases of operations. It is concluded that both H and He-related effects can occur in ITER. In particular, the case of He-induced nanostructure (also known as ‘fuzz’) is reviewed. Fuzz formation appears possible over a limited region of the outer vertical target, the inner target being generally a net Be deposition area. A simple analysis of the fuzz growth rate including the effect of edge-localized modes (ELMs) and the reduced thermal conductivity of fuzz shows that the fuzz thickness is likely to be limited by the occurrence of annealing during ELM-induced thermal excursions. Not only the morphology, but the material mechanical and thermal properties can be modified by plasma exposure. A review of the existing literature is made, but the existing data are insufficient to conclude quantitatively on the importance and extent of these effects for ITER. As a consequence of the high surface temperatures in ITER, W recrystallization is an important effect to consider, since it leads to a decrease in material strength. An approach is proposed here to develop an operational budget for the W material, i.e. the time the divertor material can be operated at a given temperature before a significant fraction of the material is recrystallized. In general, while it is clear that significant surface damage can occur during ITER operations, the tolerable level of damage in terms of plasma operations currently remains unknown.},

	abstract = {On the eve of component procurement, this paper discusses the present physics basis for the first ITER tungsten (W) divertor, beginning with a reminder of the key elements defining the overall design, and outlining relevant aspects of the Research Plan accompanying the new “staged approach” to ITER nuclear operations which fixes the overall divertor lifetime constraint. The principal focus is on the main design driver, steady state power fluxes in the DT phases, obtained from simulations using the 2-D SOLPS-4.3 and SOLPS-ITER plasma boundary codes, assuming the use of the low Z seeding impurities nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne). A new perspective on the simulation database is adopted, concentrating purely on the divertor physics aspects rather than on the core-edge integration, which has been studied extensively in the course of the divertor design evolution and is published elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on factors which may increase the peak steady state loads: divertor target shaping for component misalignment protection, the influence of fluid drifts, and the consequences of narrow scrape-off layer heat flux channels. All tend to push the divertor into an operating space at higher sub-divertor neutral pressure in order to remain at power flux densities acceptable for the target material. However, a revised criterion for the maximum tolerable loads based on avoidance of W recrystallization, sets an upper limit potentially ∼50\% higher than the previously accepted value of ∼10 MW m−2, a consequence both of the choice of material and the finalized component design. Although the simulation database is currently restricted to the 2-D toroidally symmetric situation, considerable progress is now also being made using the EMC3-Eirene 3-D code suite for the assessment of power loading in the presence of magnetic perturbations for ELM control. Some new results for low input power corresponding to the early H-mode operation phases are reported, showing that even if realistic plasma screening is taken into account, significant asymmetric divertor heat fluxes may arise far from the unperturbed strike point. The issue of tolerable limits for transient heat pulses is an open and key question. A new scaling for ELM power deposition has shown that whilst there may be more latitude for operation at higher current without ELM control, the ultimate limit is likely to be set more by material fatigue under large numbers of sub-threshold melting events.},

	abstract = {JET is used as a test bed for ITER, to investigate beryllium migration which connects the lifetime of first-wall components under erosion with tokamak safety, in relation to long-term fuel retention. The (i) limiter and the (ii) divertor configurations have been studied in JET-ILW (JET with a Be first wall and W divertor), and compared with those for the former JET-C (JET with carbon-based plasma-facing components (PFCs)). (i) For the limiter configuration, the Be gross erosion at the contact point was determined in situ by spectroscopy as between 4\% (Ein = 35 eV) and more than 100\%, caused by Be self-sputtering (Ein = 200 eV). Chemically assisted physical sputtering via BeD release has been identified to contribute to the effective Be sputtering yield, i.e. at Ein = 75 eV, erosion was enhanced by about 1/3 with respect to the bare physical sputtering case. An effective gross yield of 10\% is on average representative for limiter plasma conditions, whereas a factor of 2 difference between the gross erosion and net erosion, determined by post-mortem analysis, was found. The primary impurity source in the limiter configuration in JET-ILW is only 25\% higher (in weight) than that for the JET-C case. The main fraction of eroded Be stays within the main chamber. (ii) For the divertor configuration, neutral Be and BeD from physically and chemically assisted physical sputtering by charge exchange neutrals and residual ion flux at the recessed wall enter the plasma, ionize and are transported by scrape-off layer flows towards the inner divertor where significant net deposition takes place. The amount of Be eroded at the first wall (21 g) and the Be amount deposited in the inner divertor (28 g) are in fair agreement, though the balancing is as yet incomplete due to the limited analysis of PFCs. The primary impurity source in the JET-ILW is a factor of 5.3 less in comparison with that for JET-C, resulting in lower divertor material deposition, by more than one order of magnitude. Within the divertor, Be performs far fewer re-erosion and transport steps than C due to an energetic threshold for Be sputtering, and inhibits as a result of this the transport to the divertor floor and the pump duct entrance. The target plates in the JET-ILW inner divertor represent at the strike line a permanent net erosion zone, in contrast to the net deposition zone in JET-C with thick carbon deposits on the CFC (carbon-fibre composite) plates. The Be migration identified is consistent with the observed low long-term fuel retention and dust production with the JET-ILW.},

	abstract = {JET underwent a transformation from a full carbon-dominated tokamak to a fully metallic device with beryllium in the main chamber and a tungsten divertor. This material combination is foreseen for the activated phase of ITER. The ITER-Like Wall (ILW) experiment at JET shall demonstrate the plasma compatibility with metallic walls and the reduction in fuel retention. We report on a set of experiments (Ip = 2.0 MA, Bt = 2.0–2.4 T, δ = 0.2–0.4) in different confinement and plasma conditions with global gas balance analysis demonstrating a strong reduction in the long-term retention rate by more than a factor of 10 with respect to carbon-wall reference discharges. All experiments are executed in a series of identical plasma discharges in order to achieve maximum plasma duration until the analysis limit of the active gas handling system is reached. The composition analysis shows high purity of the recovered gas, typically 99\% D. For typical L-mode discharges (Paux = 0.5 MW), type III (Paux = 5.0 MW) and type-I ELMy H-mode plasmas (Paux = 12.0 MW) a drop of the deuterium retention rate normalized to the operational time in divertor configuration is measured from 1.27 × 1021, 1.37 × 1021 and 1.97 × 1021 D s−1 down to 4.8 × 1019, 7.2 × 1019 and 16 × 1019 D s−1, respectively. The dynamic retention increases in the limiter phase in comparison with carbon-fibre composite, but also the outgassing after the discharge has risen in the same manner and overcompensates this transient retention. Overall an upper limit of the long-term retention rate of 1.5 × 1020 D s−1 is obtained with the ILW. The observed reduction by one order of magnitude confirms the expected predictions concerning the plasma-facing material change in ITER and is in line with identification of fuel co-deposition with Be as the main mechanism for the residual long-term retention. The reduction widens the operational space without active cleaning in the DT phase in comparison with a full carbon device.},

	abstract = {Effects of surface processes on hydrogen outgassing during desorption experiments are investigated using a standard reaction–diffusion model describing hydrogen transport, retention and desorption in material. Three mechanisms for hydrogen migration and desorption on material surface are considered: hydrogen migration from material bulk to material surface (readsorption), hydrogen migration from material surface to material bulk (reabsorption) and hydrogen desorption from material surface by molecular recombination. Three hydrogen outgassing regimes are identified: (i) recombination-limited outgassing when hydrogen recombination and desorption is fast compared to hydrogen reabsorption and slow compared to hydrogen transport from material bulk onto material surface (ii) reabsorption-limited outgassing when hydrogen recombination and desorption is slow compared to hydrogen reabsorption and when the effective hydrogen recombination and desorption is slow compared to hydrogen transport from material bulk onto material surface (iii) bulk-limited outgassing otherwise. Regimes of hydrogen outgassing from tungsten and beryllium are estimated for various experimental conditions. Analytical expressions of the outgassing flux are then derived for each outgassing regime, and used to characterize TDS spectra obtained in thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments. It is shown that TDS spectra in recombination-limited regime are skewed toward high temperature, while TDS spectra in reabsorption-limited and bulk-limited regimes are skewed toward low temperature. Furthermore, the temperature of the desorption peak in TDS spectra is shown to decrease in recombination-limited regime and to increase in reabsorption-limited and bulk-limited regimes as the total amount of hydrogen stored in material increases. Finally, it is observed that the effective hydrogen recombination rate measured in reabsorption-limited permeation experiments may be not be reliably used to model and predict hydrogen retention and recycling from tungsten during plasma operations in tokamak.},

After damaging, the samples were exposed to a flux of deuterium atoms at 600 K for 70 h. During the exposure the depth profile of the retained deuterium was measured by Nuclear Reaction Analysis using a 3He ion beam. After the exposure the samples were also analysed by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy. A clear difference in the time dependence of deuterium uptake was noticed between different samples. The experimental results were modeled using a rate-equation model. The influence of different grain size was modeled by changing the effective height of the potential barrier for deuterium atoms to enter into the bulk. We managed to successfully describe the transport of deuterium into the bulk of tungsten by reducing the potential barrier for samples with smaller grain sizes while the barrier for the sample with larger grain size was close to the value for the damaged single crystal sample.},

Assuming two adsorption site types, the determined surface adsorption energies are (0.68±0.02)eV and (0.71±0.02)eV and the activation energies for migration from the surface to the bulk are (1.41±0.02)eV and (1.44±0.02)eV, respectively.

	abstract = {Beryllium (Be) has been chosen as the plasma-facing material for the main wall of ITER, the next generation fusion reactor. Identifying the key parameters that determine Be erosion under reactor relevant conditions is vital to predict the ITER plasma-facing component lifetime and viability. To date, a certain prediction of Be erosion, focusing on the effect of two such parameters, surface temperature and D surface content, has not been achieved. In this work, we develop the first multi-scale KMC-MD modeling approach for Be to provide a more accurate database for its erosion, as well as investigating parameters that affect erosion. First, we calculate the complex relationship between surface temperature and D concentration precisely by simulating the time evolution of the system using an object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) technique. These simulations provide a D surface concentration profile for any surface temperature and incoming D energy. We then describe how this profile can be implemented as a starting configuration in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We finally use MD simulations to investigate the effect of temperature (300–800 K) and impact energy (10–200 eV) on the erosion of Be due to D plasma irradiations. The results reveal a strong dependency of the D surface content on temperature. Increasing the surface temperature leads to a lower D concentration at the surface, because of the tendency of D atoms to avoid being accommodated in a vacancy, and de-trapping from impurity sites diffuse fast toward bulk. At the next step, total and molecular Be erosion yields due to D irradiations are analyzed using MD simulations. The results show a strong dependency of erosion yields on surface temperature and incoming ion energy. The total Be erosion yield increases with temperature for impact energies up to 100 eV. However, increasing temperature and impact energy results in a lower fraction of Be atoms being sputtered as BeD molecules due to the lower D surface concentrations at higher temperatures. These findings correlate well with different experiments performed at JET and PISCES-B devices.},

	abstract = {Fusion fuel retention (trapping) and release (desorption) from plasma-facing components are critical issues for ITER and for any future industrial demonstration reactors such as DEMO. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind the retention of hydrogen isotopes in first wall and divertor materials is necessary. We developed an approach that couples dedicated experimental studies with modelling at all relevant scales, from microscopic elementary steps to macroscopic observables, in order to build a reliable and predictive fusion reactor wall model. This integrated approach is applied to the ITER divertor material (tungsten), and advances in the development of the wall model are presented. An experimental dataset, including focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, isothermal desorption, temperature programmed desorption, nuclear reaction analysis and Auger electron spectroscopy, is exploited to initialize a macroscopic rate equation wall model. This model includes all elementary steps of modelled experiments: implantation of fusion fuel, fuel diffusion in the bulk or towards the surface, fuel trapping on defects and release of trapped fuel during a thermal excursion of materials. We were able to show that a single-trap-type single-detrapping-energy model is not able to reproduce an extended parameter space study of a polycrystalline sample exhibiting a single desorption peak. It is therefore justified to use density functional theory to guide the initialization of a more complex model. This new model still contains a single type of trap, but includes the density functional theory findings that the detrapping energy varies as a function of the number of hydrogen isotopes bound to the trap. A better agreement of the model with experimental results is obtained when grain boundary defects are included, as is consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the studied sample. Refinement of this grain boundary model is discussed as well as the inclusion in the model of a thin defective oxide layer following the experimental observation of the presence of an oxygen layer on the surface even after annealing to 1300 K.},

	abstract = {The recycling of D ions impinging onto a W divertor surface is a key input parameter into the power and momentum balance at the target boundary during SOL modeling. It is described by the ratio R of the flux of recombining D2 molecules to the non-reflected incident ion flux. In steady-state plasmas where the surface is in equilibrium with the incident flux, R equals one due to particle conservation. However, during transient events such as edge localized modes (ELMs) the evolution of R with time is not straightforward to predict. Therefore, detailed diffusion-trapping calculations were performed taking into account the variations in power influx and particle energy during an ELM. They showed that in contrast to the naive expectation, that the ELM would deplete the surface and subsequently lead to ‘pumping’ (R 1) of the incident flux by the empty surface, R ≈ 1 or even R occurs. This paper will first describe how the ELM was approximated in the 1D diffusion-trapping code and then discuss the evolution of R during an ELM and in the inter ELM phase. Also, an analytical picture of R will be developed which allows qualitatively understanding the evolution of R as calculated by the diffusion-trapping code.},

We summarize the benchmarking work done to ensure backward compatibility with previous work, with a strong requirement on maintaining the viability and usability of the already extensive database of SOLPS runs used for the ITER divertor design and edge plasma physics studies worldwide over the years. The SOLPS-ITER package includes not only the plasma (B2.5) and neutral (Eirene) transport solvers, but also a large set of software tools for input file build-up, conversion of old runs, inline run analysis, and post-processing, all within a standardized portable run environment and version control system. Ongoing and planned upgrades to the code, such as extending the computational domain to the full vacuum vessel wall and a new graphical user interface, are also discussed.},

Electron. Packag., 131, p. 031,010). However, our study shows that although the DCA may give reasonably accurate concentration results under several circumstances, its relative error in concentration result can be as high as 10\% in one of our test cases. More importantly, the DCA generally leads to the discontinuity of diffusion flux at the bi-material interface, which means that the result may violate the law of mass conservation. A theoretical derivation based on a one-dimensional (1-D) diffusion case is presented to demonstrate the flaw of the DCA using the finite element formulation.},

	abstract = {The impact of helium (He) plasma exposure with He fluxes relevant for ITER and WEST on the near-surface microstructure of polycrystalline tungsten (W) is investigated by coupling transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) measurements. The samples were exposed in the PSI-2 linear plasma device to 75 eV He ions up to the fluence of 3 × 1023 He m−2 with the surface temperature in the range 1053–1073 K. The obtained He bubbles–enriched W samples are subsequently probed with sequences of low flux and low fluence 250 eV deuterium (D) ion implantations and TDS measurements in an ultra-high-vacuum setup to study the effects of the near-surface morphology changes due to the helium irradiation on fundamental mechanisms of deuterium retention. The results obtained for two different near-surface layer He bubbles morphologies revealed that the effects of He irradiation on D retention in W strongly depend on its subsequent thermal cycling. For annealing below 900 K, deuterium retention is similar to the one measured in pristine W. In contrast, for annealing above 1150 K, deuterium retention in the He bubbles-enriched W is increased 3–8 fold as compared to non-damaged W. Additionally, the deuterium desorption peak shifts from 540 to 450 K. This increase of D trapping in the He bubbles-enriched W annealed above 1150 K is presumably associated with a modification of the near-surface microstructure concurrent with an outgassing of He.},

In DEMO, divertor targets must survive an environment of high heat fluxes (∼up to 20 MW m−2 during slow transients) and neutron irradiation. One advanced concept for components in monoblock configuration concerns the insertion of a compositionally graded layer between tungsten and CuCrZr instead of the soft copper interlayer. As a first step, a thin graded layer (∼25 μm) was developed. As a second step, a thicker graded layer (∼500 μm), which is actually being developed, will also be inserted to study the compliant role of a macroscopic graded layer. This paper reports the results of cyclic high heat flux loading tests up to 20 MW m−2 and to heat flux higher than 25 MW m−2 that mock-ups equipped with thin graded layer survived without visible damage. First feedback on manufacturing steps is also presented. Moreover, the first results obtained on the development of the thick graded layer and its integration in a monoblock configuration are shown.},

	abstract = {The retention of hydrogen isotopes (HIs) (H, D and T) in the first, plasma exposed wall is one of the key concerns for the operation of future long pulse fusion devices. It affects the particle-, momentum- and energy balance in the scrape off layer as well as the retention of HIs and their permeation into the coolant. The currently accepted picture that is used for interpreting current laboratory and tokamak experiments is that of diffusion hindered by trapping at lattice defects. This paper summarises recent results that show that this current picture of how HIs are transported and retained in W needs to be extended: the modification of the surface (e.g. blistering) can lead to the formation of fast loss channels for near surface HIs. Trapping at single occupancy traps with fixed de-trapping energy fails to explain isotope exchange experiments, instead a trapping model with multi occupancy traps and fill level dependent de-trapping energies is required. The presence of interstitial impurities like N or C may affect the transport of solute HI. The presence of HIs during damage creation by e.g. neutrons stabilises defects and reduces defect annealing at elevated temperatures.},

In the R\&D, the availability of the technology was demonstrated by high heat flux test of tungsten monoblock components. Not systematically but frequently macro-cracks appeared at the middle of monoblocks after 20MW/m2 loading. The initiation of such macro-cracks was considered to be due to cyclic exposure to high temperature, ∼2000°C, where creep, recrystallization and low cycle fatigue were concerned. To understand correlation between the macro-crack appearance and mechanical properties and possible update of acceptance criteria in the material specification, an activity to characterize the tungsten monoblocks was launched.},

	abstract = {A new facility to study the interaction of hydrogen isotopes with nuclear fusion-relevant first wall materials, and their retention and release, has been produced. The new facility allows for implanting a range of gases into samples, including tritium. An accurate study of isotope effects, such as the isotopic exchange in damaged microstructure, has previously been difficult due to a background signal of light hydrogen. This new capability will allow virtually background free measurements using tritium and deuterium. The design and build of this facility are described and commissioning results are presented. Within the UKAEA-led tritium retention in controlled and evolving microstructure (TRiCEM) project, this facility is used for the comparative study of deuterium retention in self-ion irradiated Eurofer steel and Fe–Cr alloy. Self-ion bombardment with energies of 0.5 MeV is used to mimic the defects created by neutrons in fusion power plants and the created traps are then filled with deuterium in the new facility. Implanted samples are analysed using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and transmission electron microscopy. Results on the total deuterium content as a function of time, TDS spectra and SIMS analysis are presented. A comparison of the results for Eurofer and Fe–Cr revealed several differences. While some of them may be due to experimental details like different time delays between exposure and analysis, others, such as deuterium retention as function of dose, might be genuine and require further studies.},

In the present work, the recombination coefficient of hydrogen (H) on tungsten (W) surface is examined. It is shown that the recombination coefficient of H on a clean W surface is extremely high which indicates the rapid desorption of the hydrogen molecule from the surface. Simulation using a high recombination coefficient well describes a wide range of experimental data of gas and ions interaction of hydrogen isotopes with tungsten. Proof of incorrectness of the Anderl's recombination coefficient is presented by comparing it with both theory and experiment.},

A simple one-parameter equation of state (the Abel–Noble equation of state) is shown to capture the real gas behavior of hydrogen and its isotopes for pressures less than 200MPa and temperatures between 223 and 423K. We use the literature on hydrogen transport in austenitic stainless steels to provide general guidance on and clarification of test procedures, and to provide recommendations for appropriate permeability, diffusivity and solubility relationships for austenitic stainless steels.

Here, focusing on tungsten as a model body-centred cubic system, we explicitly demonstrate sequential adsorption of hydrogen adatoms on Wigner–Seitz squares of nanovoids with distinct energy levels. Interaction between hydrogen adatoms on nanovoid surfaces is shown to be dominated by pairwise power-law repulsion. We establish a predictive model for quantitative determination of the configurations and energetics of hydrogen adatoms in nanovoids. This model, combined with the equation of states of hydrogen gas, enables the prediction of hydrogen molecule formation in nanovoids. Multiscale simulations, performed based on our model, show good agreement with recent thermal desorption experiments. This work clarifies fundamental physics and provides a full-scale predictive model for hydrogen trapping and bubbling in nanovoids, offering long-sought mechanistic insights that are crucial for understanding hydrogen-induced damage in structural materials.},

On the basis of the experience acquired during the ITER safety expertise, the IRSN has carried out a preliminary study of the safety issues which seem necessary to take into account right from the earliest design phase of these DEMO facilities. The issues studied have included the decay heat removal, exposure to ionizing radiation, potential accidents, and effluent releases and waste. The study shows that it will be important to give priority to the following actions, given that their results would have a major influence on the design: assess if decay heat removal is a safety function, re-study the accidents considered in the context of the ITER project and identify those specific to DEMO, and optimize each of the main routes for gaseous tritium releases.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen in metals attracts interest from scientists since many decades. Most of the interesting properties are related to the small size of hydrogen: its interstitial diffusion accompanied by quantum mechanical tunnel transport results in an extraordinary high mobility of hydrogen atoms in materials. For metals, H diffusivity may reach values as known for ions in aqueous solutions. Thus, thermodynamic equilibrium is reached within comparably short times even at room temperature. Therefore, metal–hydrogen systems are often used as model systems to study physical or chemical properties and their change with concentration (see, for example Oates and Flanagan, 1981, 1981a or Pundt and Kirchheim (2006)). In 1937, Lacher (1937) already used Pd–H (Flanagan and Oates, 1981, 1991) to study solute–solute interactions and interpreted it in the framework of a quasi-chemical approach (Lacher, 1937). The quantum mechanical tunneling as a diffusion mechanism also for atoms in solids was first discovered and discussed for hydrogen tunneling in metals (Flynn and Stoneham, 1970; Völk and Alefeld, 1975; Birnbaum and Flynn, 1976). Völk and Alefeld (1978), Zabel and Peisl (1979, 1980), and Steyrer and Peisl (1986) studied hydrogen density modulations that are related to the sample geometry; and Zabel and his colleagues, as published by Miceli et al. (1985), Uher et al. (1987), Song et al. (1996, 2000), and Uher et al. (1987), firstly used metal–hydrogen systems to study the behavior of systems with reduced dimensions and modulated hydrogen affinity. Kirchheim (1988) and colleagues extensively studied metal–hydrogen systems as representative for solute/solvent systems. The high mobility of hydrogen further allows studying the impact of defects that usually annihilate at elevated temperatures, see Gottstein (2001). It was, therefore, suggested to use hydrogen as a probe for defects (Cahn, 1990; Flanagan et al., 2001a, 2001b; Kirchheim, 2004) and perform site energy spectroscopy by gradually increasing the hydrogen chemical potential.},

Traps are characterized by their nature, i.e., reversible or irreversible, saturable or unsaturable. A dislocation core is a saturable, reversible trap, while voids and crack are unsaturable, reversible traps. A trap model based on saturable, reversible traps is developed, which is slightly different from the trap model of McNabb and Foster. In equilibrium, the trap model corresponds to Oriani’s trap model. Kumnick and Johnson found experimentally that the trap density increases as the plastic strain increases. Using their trap data, it is shown that equilibrium between hydrogen in lattice sites and trap sites can be assumed when strain rates are used as in standard tensile tests.},

For the tritium concentration evaluation within each sub-system of the fuel cycle of ITER, a finite volume computer program was developed for diffusion analysis of hydrogen isotopes in composite materials. The program calculates hydrogen isotope concentration distributions through composite materials such as tritium permeation barriers as function of the applied boundary conditions. The program can simulate hydrogen isotopes diffusion through single materials and composite materials in one-dimensional and can also make the output visualization. We look forward to making some comparison calculation for the present calculation with TMAP.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a finite element formulation for solving coupled mechanical/diffusion problems. In particular, we study hydrogen diffusion in metals and its impact on their mechanical behaviour (i.e. hydrogen embrittlement). The formulation can be used to model hydrogen diffusion through a material and its accumulation within different microstructural features of the material (dislocations, precipitates, interfaces, etc.). Further, the effect of hydrogen on the plastic response and cohesive strength of different interfaces can be incorporated. The formulation adopts a standard Galerkin method in the discretisation of both the diffusion and mechanical equilibrium equations. Thus, a displacement-based finite element formulation with chemical potential as an additional degree of freedom, rather than the concentration, is employed. Consequently, the diffusion equation can be expressed fundamentally in terms of the gradient in chemical potential, which reduces the continuity requirements on the shape functions to zero degree, \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\}\_\{0\}\$\$C0, i.e. linear functions, compared to the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\}\_\{1\}\$\$C1continuity condition required when concentration is adopted. Additionally, a consistent interface element formulation can be achieved due to the continuity of the chemical potential across the interface—concentration can be discontinuous at an interface which can lead to numerical problems. As a result, the coding of the FE equations is more straightforward. The details of the physical problem, the finite element formulation and constitutive models are initially discussed. Numerical results for various example problems are then presented, in which the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation are explored and a comparison with the concentration-based formulations is presented.},

	abstract = {The high-energy, high-intensity neutron fluxes produced by the fusion plasma will have a significant life-limiting impact on reactor components in both experimental and commercial fusion devices. As well as producing defects, the neutrons bombarding the materials initiate nuclear reactions, leading to transmutation of the elemental atoms. Products of many of these reactions are gases, particularly helium, which can cause swelling and embrittlement of materials. This paper integrates several different computational techniques to produce a comprehensive picture of the response of materials to neutron irradiation, enabling the assessment of structural integrity of components in a fusion power plant. Neutron-transport calculations for a model of the next-step fusion device DEMO reveal the variation in exposure conditions in different components of the vessel, while inventory calculations quantify the associated implications for transmutation and gas production. The helium production rates are then used, in conjunction with a simple model for He-induced grain-boundary embrittlement based on electronic-structure density functional theory calculations, to estimate the timescales for susceptibility to grain-boundary failure in different fusion-relevant materials. There is wide variation in the predicted grain-boundary-failure lifetimes as a function of both microstructure and chemical composition, with some conservative predictions indicating much less than the required lifetime for components in a fusion power plant.},

The influence of the monoblock surface temperature, the incident ion energy and particle flux on the monoblock hydrogen inventory is investigated.

Using this inventory map, the hydrogen inventory in the divertor is easily derived for any type of scenario. Here, the case of a detached ITER scenario with inputs from the SOLPS code is presented. For this scenario, the hydrogen inventory per monoblock is highly dependent of surface temperature and ranges from \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$\$1018to \$\$6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$\$6×1019H after a \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$\$107s exposure.

The stability of such objects results from a competitive process between thermal emission of vacancies, self interstitial atoms (SIAs), and helium, depending on the helium-to-vacancy ratio in mixed clusters or helium number in pure interstitial helium clusters. We investigated in particular the ground state configurations as well as the activation barriers of self trapping and trap mutation, i.e., the emission of one SIA along with the creation of one vacancy from a vacancy-helium or pure helium object.},

Using object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (pseudo-3D simulations) parameterized from first principles, we show that this temperature dependence can be understood based on He and point defect clustering, cluster growth, and detrapping reactions. At low temperatures ({\textless}900 K), fuzz does not grow because almost all He is trapped in very small He-vacancy clusters. At high temperatures ({\textgreater}2300 K), all He is detrapped from clusters, preventing the formation of the large clusters that lead to fuzz growth in the intermediate temperature range.},

Such estimates are presented in different circumstances, including the localization of A,B on a common planar surface or their distribution in space, and also when the domain of A is a half space whereas that of B is a bounding planar surface. It proves advantageous to reformulate the last, a mixed boundary value problem, in terms of a linear integral equation.

Our recent experiments have shown that nanochannel tungsten (W) films have clearly superior radiation tolerance properties. In the present work, helium clustering and release from nanochannel tungsten were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of temperature and vacancy concentration on the helium release from a tungsten cylinder were investigated. Our results show that nanochannel W that consists of thin W cylinders releases He atoms more quickly than bulk W with flat surfaces, thus greatly reducing the He concentration and suppressing the formation and growth of He bubbles, which leads to increased radiation tolerance. Moreover, the microstructural changes due to increasing He fluence are smaller in nanochannel W than those in bulk W. Although vacancies in nanochannel W will trap He atoms, the nanochannel W also has a stronger tendency to stabilize helium retention than bulk W. The mechanism of helium release from nanochannel W was also examined. The results reported here are beneficial for guiding future work in the design of radiation resistant PFMs.},

In the present work, three tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}, \{110\} and \{111\} -oriented were studied by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. We find that the tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}-oriented retain fewer helium atoms than the tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{110\} or \{111\}-oriented. Moreover, the microstructural changes of tungsten columns whose top surfaces are \{100\}-oriented are smaller than others after high helium fluence exposure, which indicates that the nanochannel tungsten film maybe more suitable than bulk tungsten for plasma facing material in releasing helium atoms and delaying the formation of “fuzz” structure.
