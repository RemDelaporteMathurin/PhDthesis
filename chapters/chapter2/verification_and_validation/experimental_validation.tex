Now that the code has been verified (\textit{ie} it solves the governing equations correctly), experimental validation is still required to check that these equations actually represent experimentally observed processes.
A very good example of experiments that can be reproduced are Thermo-Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) experiments also called Thermally Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiments.
The principle of such experiments is to load samples with hydrogen isotopes either via gas infusion, plasma implantation or electrochemical charging.
The samples are then heated up to different temperatures to desorb the trapped hydrogen.
By measuring the outgassing flux of particles throughout the time of the experiment, desorption spectra are obtained.
These spectra often exhibit several peaks and each peak correspond to a kind of trap (in most cases).

This technique is therefore employed to characterise materials and their defects. 
It is also a very good application case for experimental validation of the hydrogen transport model.

This section describes the technique that was employed to easily reproduce these TDS experiments.
