Verification is the process of ensuring the governing equations are correctly solved in FESTIM.
This is an integral part of every simulation code for it guarantees the code is error free.
It is generally hard to simply substitute this process by code comparison (cross-checks between two different codes) because often the codes are implemented differently.
Moreover, if the code we are comparing with is not verified, then obtaining similar results does not give any guarantee on the code accuracy.

Several methods can be used to verify a code but the Method of Exact Solutions (MES) and the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) are employed here.

Both methods consist in comparing a computed solution with an exact solution and measuring the error.
The exact solution in the MES is obtained by solving the governing equations analytically.
When using the MMS, on the other hand, the problem is reversed: an arbitrary exact solution (called \textit{manufactured solution}) is chosen and injected in the governing equations.
It is then possible to determine source terms and boundary conditions.
These are then fed into the code and the computed solution is compared to the manufactured (exact) solution.

This MMS method is often used to unravel the complexity of governing equations \sidecite{dudson_verification_2016, roache_code_2002}.
This is particularly usefull when dealing with complex geometries or to exercise non-trivial material propoerties.

\subsubsection{H transport (MES)} \label{analytical}

% Although validation against experiments could show that FESTIM is able reproduce the data with a given set of parameters, objective verification against analytical solutions is first required to ensure that the governing Equations \ref{eq:mobile} and \ref{eq:trapped} are solved correctly.

For this verification case, a 1D slab is considered with a thickness $l$.
The concentration of mobile particles was set to $c_0$ on one side of the slab and set to zero on the other side.
Only one trap is considered in this case and its density $n_1$ is homogeneously distributed.

The trapping parameter $\zeta$ is defined in \sidecite{longhurst_verification_2005} as follow:
\begin{equation}
    \zeta = \frac{\lambda^2 \: n_\mathrm{solute} \: \nu_0}{D_0 \: n_1}\exp\bigg(\frac{E_\mathrm{diff} - E_1}{k_B \: T}\bigg) + \frac{c_\mathrm{m}}{n_1}
\end{equation}

In our case, we choose the detrapping energy $E_1$, the concentration $c_0$ and the temperature $T$ so that $\zeta \gg \frac{c_\mathrm{m}}{n_1}$.
This is known as the \textit{effective diffusivity regime} where the diffusion is almost identical to the case where there are no traps.
The coefficient $D$ is then replaced by an effective diffusion coefficient:
\begin{equation}
    D_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{D}{1+\frac{1}{\zeta}}
\end{equation}
The particle flux at the background surface is expressed in $\SI{}{H.m^{-2}.s^{-1}}$ and finally defined in \sidecite{longhurst_verification_2005} by:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi_H(t) = \frac{c_0 D}{l}\bigg[1+2\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^m \exp\bigg(-m^2\frac{\pi^2 \:D_\mathrm{eff} \: t}{l^2}\bigg)\bigg]
\label{eq:flux analytical}
\end{equation}
All the parameters are defined in Table \ref{tab:parameters analytical verification}.
These parameters have been chosen for the sake of verification and do not necessarily represent realistic conditions as verification is a mathematical exercise.

One can notice on Figure \ref{fig:FESTIM vs analytical} that the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solution.
The maximum error between analytical and numerical solutions is calculated to be \SI{6.56e20}{H.m^{-2}.s^{-1}} with 50000 piecewise linear elements (P1) which corresponds to \SI{1}{\%} of the maximum value.
According to finite elements theory, this value will decrease with the stepsize and with the element size.

\end{figure}

Since this test case is very similar to a pure diffusion case, it does not exercise all terms of the governing equations.
To do so, the governing equations would have to be solved for a generic case which proves to be complex.
This is why the MMS will be used instead.

\subsubsection{H transport (MMS)} \label{mms}

In order to exercise all terms of Equations \ref{eq:mobile} and \ref{eq:trapped}, the following manufactured solutions are chosen:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    c_{m_D} = 1 + x^2 + \sin(t) \\
    c_{{t,1}_D} = 1 + x^2 + \cos(t)
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq: manufactured solutions}
\end{equation}

By combining Equations \ref{eq:mobile}, \ref{eq:trapped} and \ref{eq: manufactured solutions}, one can obtain the following source terms:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    f = \cos(t) - \sin(t) - 2D \\
    g_1 = \nu_1 c_{{t,1}_D} - \nu_m c_{m_D} ( n_1 - c_{{t,1}_D}) - \sin(t)
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:sources}
\end{equation}

where $g_1$ is an additional source term in Equation \ref{eq:trapped}.
The Dirichlet boundary conditions for $c_\mathrm{m}$ and $c_{t,1}$ are:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    c_\mathrm{m} = 1 + x^2 + \sin(t) \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega \\
    c_{t,1} = 1 + x^2 + \cos(t) \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\partial\Omega$ is the boundary of the domain.
Finally, initial values for $c_\mathrm{m}$ and $c_{t,i}$ are:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    c_\mathrm{m}(t=0) = 1 + x^2 \\
    c_{t,1}(t=0) = 2 + x^2
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Once all these parameters are fed into FESTIM, one can easily compare the computed solution with the exact solution in Equation \ref{eq: manufactured solutions}.
The L2-norm $E_{c_\mathrm{m}}$ can then be calculated as follow:
\begin{equation}
    E_{c_\mathrm{m}} = \sqrt{\int_\Omega(c_{m_D} - c_\mathrm{m})^2dx}
\end{equation}
The evolution of $E_{c_\mathrm{m}}$ as function of the element size $h$ is shown on Figure \ref{fig:error vs h}.
One can notice that $E_{c_\mathrm{m}}$ increases as $A\cdot h^k$.
This is known as the \textit{asymptotic regime} and the coefficient $k$ is called the convergence rate.
$k$ typically tends to N+1 as $h$ approaches $0$, $N$ being the order of the finite elements.
In this simulation, $k$ approaches $2$ as expected since elements of order $1$ have been used.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{"Figures/Chapter3/L2 error on Cm vs h"}
    \caption{Evolution of the L2 norm of the error as function of element size h for the 1D H transport case.}
    \label{fig:error vs h}
\end{figure}

The same method can be applied to a 2D case.
Let us choose the following steady state test problem on a domain $\Omega = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ with the manufactured solution $c_D(x, y) = \sin(\omega \pi x) \sin(\omega \pi y)$.

\begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot D \nabla c_\mathrm{m} &= -f_1 \\
    k c_\mathrm{m} (n - c_\mathrm{t}) - p c_\mathrm{t} &= -f_2 \\
    c_\mathrm{m} &= c_\mathrm{t} = c_D \text{  on  } \partial \Omega \\
    D &= 2 \\
    p &= 3 \\
    k &= 2 \\
\end{align}

The source terms $f_1$ and $f_2$ and the boundary conditions can be obtained in a similar fashion by replacing $c_\mathrm{m}$ and $c_\mathrm{t}$ in the governing equations.

It was shown that the computed solutions was similar to the exact solutions (see Figure \ref{fig: results MMS 2D H transport}).
Moreover, the convergence rates confirm the mesh dependency of the computed solutions accuracy (see Figure \ref{fig: convergence rates H}).
A super-convergence is observed for the P2 elements.

\subsubsection{Conservation of chemical potential (MES)}
This verification case aims at checking the FESTIM code is correctly solving the governing Equations \ref{eq: flux conservation}, \ref{eq: c/s conservation}, \ref{eq: diffusion equation} and \ref{eq: diffusion equation changed}.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Concentration profiles simulated by FESTIM against analytical solutions.}
    \label{fig:comparison MES}
\end{figure*}

The uni-dimensional test case considered in this Section was made of two subdomains $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ and is described as follow:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \Omega &= [0, L] = \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2 \\
    \Omega_1 &= [0, x_\mathrm{int}] \\
    \Omega_2 &= [x_\mathrm{int}, L] \\
    D &= \begin{cases}
        D_1,& \text{ in } \Omega_1\\
        D_2,& \text{ in } \Omega_2
    \end{cases} \\
    S &= \begin{cases}
        S_1,& \text{ in } \Omega_1\\
        S_2,& \text{ in } \Omega_2
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The following dimensionless quantities are introduced:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m} &= c_\mathrm{m} / c_0\\
        \tilde{x} &= x / L \\
        \tilde{f} &= f \frac{L^2}{D_\mathrm{eq} c_0} \\
        \alpha &= D_2/D_1 \\
        \beta &= S_2/S_1 \\
        \gamma &= x_\mathrm{int}/L\\
    \end{align} 
\end{subequations}
where $D_\mathrm{eq} = (D_1 D_2)^{1/2}$.

By integrating Equation \ref{eq: diffusion equation} and assuming steady-state (\textit{i.e.} $\partial c/\partial t=0$), one can obtain the following dimensionless form:

\begin{equation}
        \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}= 
\begin{cases}
    -\frac{1}{2}\alpha^{1/2}\tilde{f} \tilde{x}^2 + a_1 \tilde{x} + b_1,& \text{ in } \Omega_1\\
    -\frac{1}{2}\alpha^{-1/2}\tilde{f} \tilde{x}^2 + a_2 \tilde{x} + b_2,& \text{ in } \Omega_2
\end{cases}
\label{eq:MES c}
\end{equation}

where $a_1$, $b_1$, $a_2$, $b_2$ are the unknowns of the problem to be determined.
The boundary conditions and the equilibrium law at the interface are defined as:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq: bcs MES}
\begin{align} 
        \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}(\tilde{x}=0) & = 1 \\
        \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}(\tilde{x}=1) & =  \tilde{c}_L \\
        \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}^-(\tilde{x}=\gamma) & =  \beta \; \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}^+(\tilde{x}=\gamma)\\
        \nabla \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}^-(\tilde{x}=\gamma) & =  \alpha \nabla \tilde{c}_\mathrm{m}^+(\tilde{x}=\gamma)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


Equation \ref{eq:MES c} can be solved with these constraints and coefficients describing $\tilde{c_\mathrm{m}}$ therefore read:

\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        a_1 &= a_0 \; \alpha^{1/2}  \\
        b_1 &= 1 \\
        a_2 &= a_0 \; \alpha^{-1/2}\\
        b_2 &= \tilde{c}_L + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^{-1/2} \tilde{f} - a_2 \\
        a_0 &= \frac{2 \alpha^{1/2}( \tilde{c}_L - \beta) + \tilde{f} \gamma^{2} ( 1 - \alpha \beta)}{2 \left( 1  - \gamma + \alpha \beta \gamma \right)} \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq: MES c coefficients}
\end{align}

It is worth noting that when $\beta=1$ (\textit{i.e.} $S_1 = S_2 = S$) the solution becomes independent of $S$ and {$c_\mathrm{m}^{-}(x_\mathrm{int}) = c_\mathrm{m}^{+}(x_\mathrm{int})$}.
Moreover, when $\alpha = 1$ (\textit{i.e.} $D_1 = D_2 = D$), then $a_1 = a_2 = a_0$ which is the solution for steady-state diffusion in a mono-material.

The solution computed by FESTIM was found to be in very good agreement with the analytical solution for several test cases (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison MES}).

 
However, this method does not exercise all the terms in the governing Equation \ref{eq: diffusion equation changed}.
For instance, this analytical solution is only uni-dimensional, steady state is assumed and material properties are constant within the materials.
Having an exact solution from an analytical resolution for a general problem (multidimensional, transient, heterogeneous material properties, etc...) is often complex.
In order to exercise all these terms, the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) will therefore be employed for it offers a good alternative to unravel these complexities.

\subsubsection{Conservation of chemical potential (MMS)}

This verification case aims at checking the FESTIM code is correctly solving the governing Equations \ref{eq: flux conservation}, \ref{eq: c/s conservation}, \ref{eq: diffusion equation} and \ref{eq: diffusion equation changed}.

The domain $\Omega$ for this test problem is a unit square composed of two subdomains $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ (see Equation \ref{eq: MMS domain}).
\begin{subequations} \label{eq: MMS domain}
\begin{align}
    \Omega &= [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \\
    \Omega_1 &= [0, x_\mathrm{int}] \times [0, 1] \\
    \Omega_2 &= [x_\mathrm{int}, 1] \times [0, 1] \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
In order to unravel the complexity of an analytical resolution of the direct problem, a manufactured solution $c_\mathrm{m}$ was constructed (see Equation \ref{eq: manufactured solution}) and the problem was solved backwards.

\begin{equation}
        c_M= 
\begin{cases}
    c_{M1},& \text{ on } \Omega_1\\
    \frac{S_2}{S_1} \cdot c_{M1},& \text{ on } \Omega_2
\end{cases}
\label{eq: manufactured solution}
\end{equation}
where $c_{M1} = 2 + \cos(2\pi x) \cdot \cos(2\pi y) + t$

It is worth noting that, when choosing a manufactured solution, one must ensure it satisfies all the governing equations (especially Equations \ref{eq: flux conservation} and \ref{eq: c/s conservation}).
In our case, $c_M$ ensures the flux conservation at the interface and the continuity of the quantity $c_\mathrm{m}/S$.

Properties are assumed time and space dependent in order to test every portion of the code (see Equation \ref{eq: MMS properties}).
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        D_1(x, y, t) & =  D_{1_0} \exp(-E_{D_1}/(k_B \cdot T(x,y, t) )) \\
        D_2(x, y, t) & =  D_{2_0} \exp(-E_{D_2}/(k_B \cdot T(x,y, t) )) \\
        S_1(x, y, t) & =  S_{1_0} \exp(-E_{S_1}/(k_B \cdot T(x,y, t) )) \\
        S_2(x, y, t) & =  S_{2_0} \exp(-E_{S_2}/(k_B \cdot T(x,y, t) )) \\
        T(x, y, t) & = 500 + 30 \cos(2\pi x) \cos(2 \pi y) \cos(2 \pi t)
\end{align} \label{eq: MMS properties}
\end{subequations}
with ${k_B = \SI{8.617e-5}{eV.K^{-1}}}$ the Boltzmann constant, $D_{1_0} = 1$, $E_{D_1} = 0.1$, $D_{2_0} = 2$, $E_{D_2} = 0.2$, $S_{1_0} = 1$, $E_{S_1} = 0.1$, $S_{2_0} = 2$ and $E_{S_2} = 0.2$.
The temperature $T$ varies around \SI{500}{K} so that, given the activation energies, properties do not approach zero.

By injecting the manufactured solution $c_M$ into the governing Equation \ref{eq: diffusion equation}, the source term can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
    f(x, y, t) &= \frac{\partial c_M}{\partial t} - \vec{\nabla} \cdot\left(D(x, y)
    \vec{\nabla}c_M\right) \nonumber \\
    &= \begin{cases}
        \frac{\partial c_{M_1}}{\partial t} - \vec{\nabla} \cdot\left(D_1(x, y)
    \vec{\nabla}c_{M_1}\right),& \text{ on } \Omega_1\\
    \frac{\partial c_{M_2}}{\partial t} - \vec{\nabla} \cdot\left(D_2(x, y)
    \vec{\nabla}c_{M_2}\right),& \text{ on } \Omega_2\\
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

The source term $f$ was then fed into FESTIM alongside with the initial and boundary conditions described below:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        c_\mathrm{m}(x, y, t) &= c_M(x, y, t), \text{ on } \partial \Omega \\
        c_\mathrm{m}(x, y, t=0) &= c_M(x, y, t=0), \text{ on } \Omega
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The computed solution $c_\mathrm{comp}$ can then be compared with the manufactured solution $c_M$ in order to quantitatively measure the numerical error.
After running the MMS process, the computed solution and the manufactured solution were in very good agreement at several arbitrarily chosen times of simulation (see Figure \ref{fig: results MMS}).
% The stepsize was $\Delta t=0.01$.
The absolute difference between the manufactured solution and the computed one was found to be zero on the boundary and maximum at the interface between the two materials.
This is explained by the Dirichlet boundary conditions enforcing the computed solution on the boundary.
This difference decreases by increasing the mesh refinement and decreasing the stepsize.
Nonetheless, the error was found to remain orders of magnitude lower than the actual solution.

\subsubsection{Heat transfer (MMS)}

% why not use a complex geometry? like an elbow

The heat transfer module in FESTIM can also be verified using the method of manufactured solutions.

Let us choose the following test problem on a elbow domain $\Omega = [0, 1] \times [0, 0.5] \cup [0, 0.5] \times [0.5, 1]$ with the manufactured solution $T_D(x, y) = \sin(\omega \pi x) \sin(\omega \pi y)$.

\begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot \lambda \nabla T &= -f \\
    T &= T_D \text{  on  } y \in [0, 1] \\
    -\lambda \nabla T \cdot \mathbf{n} &= -\lambda \nabla T_D \cdot \mathbf{n} \text{  on  other surfaces} \\
    \lambda(x, y) &= 2 + T_D^2 \\
\end{align}

The source term $f$ is therefore:
\begin{align}
    f &= 2 \pi^{2} \omega^{2} f_0 \sin{\left (\pi \omega x \right )} \sin{\left (\pi \omega y \right )} \\
    f_0 &= \left(3 f_1 f_2 - f_1 - f_2 + 2\right) \\
    f_1 &= \sin^{2}{\left (\pi \omega x \right )} \\
    f_2 &= \sin^{2}{\left (\pi \omega y \right )} \\
\end{align}

The computed FESTIM solution is extremely similar to the exact solution (see Figure \ref{fig: results MMS heat transfer}).
It is also possible to compute the L2-error for several number of cell divisions in the x and y directions $N$ to ensure the error decreases as a power law of $N$.
Moreover, the L2-error (the exponent of the power law) should vary as $h^{d+1}$ where $h=1/N$ and $d$ is the polynomial degree of the elements.
This was verified for P1 and P3 elements and a super-convergence rate was observed for the P2 elements (see Figure \ref{fig: convergence rates heat transfer}).
