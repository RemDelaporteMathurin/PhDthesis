\section{Introduction}
This Chapter describes the mathematical models needed to simulate H transport in tokamaks plasma facing components.
The numerical scheme to solve these equations and an introduction to the finite element method alongside with its implementation in the FESTIM code are also presented.
Finally, the verification \& validation of FESTIM is performed to guaranty its reliability.

\section{H transport} \label{description_H_transport_model}

This Section describes the main model for simulating H transport in materials.

\subsection{Macroscopic Rate Equations model}

The Macroscopic Rate Equations (MRE) model will be employed.
The principle is to split the hydrogen isotopes into several populations: the mobile hydrogen particles and the hydrogen particles trapped in the i-th trap.
Their concentration in \si{H.m^{-3}} are respectively $c_\mathrm{m}$ and $c_{\mathrm{t},i}$.
The unit of the different concentrations are in $ \si{m^{-3}}$ but can be expressed in atomic fraction (at.fr.) by normalising them to the atomic density of the material.

Fick's first law of diffusion states that the particle flux is driven by the concentration gradient.
The particle flux $J$ is therefore expressed by:
\begin{equation}
    J = - D \nabla c_\mathrm{m}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient in \si{m^2.s^{-1}}.
This expression neglects the Soret effect or the effect of hydrostatic pressure.

% This particle flux can be expressed differently if additionnal physics are accounted for.
% For instance, taking into account the Soret effect (also called thermodiffusion or thermophoresis), the particle flux is expressed as:
% \begin{equation}
%     J = - D \nabla c_\mathrm{m} - D \frac{c_\mathrm{m} Q}{R T^2} \nabla T
% \end{equation}
% where $Q$ is the Soret coefficient (or heat of transport) expressed in \si{J.mol^{-1}}, $T$ is the temperature in \si{K} and $R=\SI{8.314}{J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}}$ is the gas constant.
% This effect will enhance the diffusion when particles diffuse from a hot region to a cold region.
% It should be noted however that the Soret coefficient is fairly difficult to measure.

The spatio temporal evolution of these concentrations are commonly described by the following reaction-diffusion system:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial c_\mathrm{m}}{\partial t}=\nabla \cdot J+\Gamma-\sum \frac{\partial c_{\mathrm{t}, i}}{\partial t}
    \label{eq:mobile}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial c_{\mathrm{t}, i}}{\partial t}=k \cdot c_\mathrm{m} \cdot\left(n_{i}-c_{\mathrm{t}, i}\right)-p \cdot c_{\mathrm{t}, i}
    \label{eq:trapped}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:mobile}, $\Gamma$ is the volumetric source term of particles in \si{m^{-3}.s^{-1}}.
The volumetric source term can be used to simulate any process producing H in the bulk.
This is the case for plasma implantation and nuclear reactions producing H.

In Equation \ref{eq:trapped}, $k$ and $p$ are the trapping and detrapping rates expressed in \si{m^3.s^{-1}} and \si{s^{-1}} respectively and $n_i$ is the trap density in \si{m^{-3}}.

At steady state (\textit{ie} $\frac{\partial c_\mathrm{m}}{\partial t} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial c_{\mathrm{t}, i}}{\partial t} = 0$), the mobile H concentration is independent of trapping effects.
Equation \ref{eq:trapped} can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
    c_{\mathrm{t}, i} = n_i \frac{1}{\frac{p}{k c_\mathrm{m}} + 1}
    \label{eq: steady state ct}
\end{equation}
The quantity $(p / (k c_\mathrm{m}) + 1)^{-1}$ determines the filling ratio of the trap. 
When it approaches one (high mobile concentration, low detrapping rate or high trapping rate), the trapped concentration approaches the trap density.
When it approahces zero (high detrapping rate, low mobile concentration or low trapping rate), the trapped concentration approaches zero.
Moreover, the mobile H concentration is independent of trapping effects.

\subsection{Boundary conditions}

Several boundary conditions will be employed in order to constrain either the actual solution (Dirichlet) or the solution gradient (Neumann, Robin) at the domain's boundaries.

\subsubsection{Dissociation and recombination fluxes}

The concentration gradient can also be constrained on the boundaries (see Equation \ref{eq: neuman robin bc}).

\begin{equation}
    - D(T)\nabla c_\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathbf{n} = f(x, t) \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: neuman robin bc}
\end{equation}
where $D(T) = D_0 \exp(\frac{-E_D}{k_B T}) $ is the diffusion coefficient in \si{m^2.s^{-1}}, $T$ is the local temperature in \si{K}, $\mathbf{n}$ is the boundary normal vector and $\partial \Omega$ is the domain boundary.

$f$ can also be expressed as a molecular recombination flux:
\begin{equation}
    - D(T)\nabla c_\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathbf{n} = K_r(T) c_\mathrm{m}^n \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: recombination flux}
\end{equation}
where $K_r(T) = K_{r_0} \exp(\frac{-E_{K_r}}{k_B T}) $ is the recombination coefficient expressed in \si{m^{3n-2}.s^{-1}}, $\mathbf{n}$ is the boundary normal vector and $n \in \{1, 2\}$ is the order of the recombination.
Recombination occurs when hydrogen particles located at the surface of the material combine with other particles (which can be other hydrogen particles) and are no longer bonded with the metal surface.
It can happen both in presence of a vacuum or when the metal is in contact with a fluid (gas or fluid).

Similarily, a dissociation flux can be applied when a surface is in contact with a gas atmosphere of H (see Equation \ref{eq: dissociation flux}).
\begin{equation}
    - D(T)\nabla c_\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathbf{n} = K_d(T) P \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: dissociation flux}
\end{equation}
where $K_d(T) = K_{d_0} \exp(\frac{-E_{K_d}}{k_B T}) $ is the dissociation coefficient expressed in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-1}} and $\mathbf{n}$ is the boundary normal vector.
Dissociation is the opposite process of recombination and occurs when particles in the surrounding atmosphere or fluid reach the metal surface and are adsorbed.
These particle can then reach the bulk and diffuse in the metal.

A steady-state approximation of the flux balance between recombination and dissociation fluxes is the Sievert's law (see Equation \ref{eq: Sievert's law}).

\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{m} = S(T) \sqrt{P}\quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: Sievert's law}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the partial pressure of hydrogen at the boundary in \si{Pa}, $S(T)=S_0 \exp(\frac{-E_S}{k_B T})$ is the material solubility in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-1/2}} and $T$ is the local temperature in \si{K}.
This law of equilibrium is a steady-state approximation of a more complex model which takes into account flux exchanges between adsorbed and mobile concentrations at the boundary.
It is therefore valid when applied to cases where the kinetics are fast enough for the system to remain at equilibrium.

\subsubsection{Analytical simplification for implanted sources of H} \label{triangle model}

Plasma implantation of hydrogen particles can be modelled with a volumetric source.
Typically, the depth of the implantation profile is a few nanometres (depending on the incident particles energy).
These profiles can be simulated by Monte Carlo codes like SRIM \sidecite{ziegler_srim_2010} and have a gaussian-like shape.
% In order to accurately model this source term, the size of the cells constituing the mesh (the spatial discretisation of the domain) must be less than a nanometre.
% This can be done easily in 1D but is very complicated in higher dimensions, especially when simulating centimetre-sized components.
This volumetric source term can be simplified into a Dirichlet boundary condition (\textit{ie} enforcing the mobile particle concentration at the exposed surface).

Let us consider a volumetric source term of hydrogen $\Gamma = \varphi_\mathrm{imp} \; f(x)$ where $f$ is a narrow Gaussian distribution.
The mobile particles concentration profile can be approximated by a triangular shape \sidecite{schmid_diffusion-trapping_2016} (see Figure \ref{fig:recomb sketch}).

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter2/recomb_sketch.pdf}
    \caption{Concentration profile with recombination flux and volumetric source term at $x=R_p$. Dashed lines correspond to the time evolution.}
    \label{fig:recomb sketch}
\end{figure*}

The concentration profile is therefore maximum at $x=R_p$.
The expression of $c_\mathrm{max}$ can be obtained by expressing the flux balance at equilibrium:

\begin{equation}
    \varphi_\mathrm{imp} = \varphi_\mathrm{recomb} + \varphi_\mathrm{bulk}
    \label{eq:flux balance}
\end{equation}
where $\varphi_\mathrm{recomb}$ is the recombination flux and $\varphi_\mathrm{bulk}$ is the migration flux.

$\varphi_\mathrm{bulk}$ can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi_\mathrm{bulk} = D \cdot \frac{c_\mathrm{max}}{R_d(t) - R_p}
\end{equation}

% When $t \rightarrow \infty$ or $R_d \gg R_p$ (a ratio of 10 or 100 is enough), $\varphi_\mathrm{bulk} \ll \varphi_\mathrm{recomb}$.
When $R_d \gg R_p$, $\varphi_\mathrm{bulk} \rightarrow 0$.
Equation \ref{eq:flux balance} can therefore be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi_\mathrm{recomb} \approx \varphi_\mathrm{imp}
    \label{eq:flux balance 2}
\end{equation}

Moreover, according to Fick's law, $\varphi_\mathrm{recomb}$ can be expressed as:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \varphi_\mathrm{recomb} &= D \cdot \frac{c_\mathrm{max}-c_{0}}{R_{p}} = \varphi_\mathrm{imp}\\
    \Leftrightarrow c_\mathrm{max} &= \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp} R_{p}}{D}+ c_0
    \label{eq:c_max}
\end{eqnarray}

Assuming second order recombination, $\varphi_\mathrm{recomb}$ can also be expressed as a function of the recombination coefficient $K$:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \varphi_\mathrm{recomb} &= K c_{0}^{2} = \varphi_\mathrm{imp}\\
    \Leftrightarrow c_{0} &= \sqrt{\frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp}}{K}}
    \label{eq:c_0}
\end{eqnarray}

By replacing Equation \ref{eq:c_0} in Equation \ref{eq:c_max} one can obtain:

\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{max} = \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp} R_{p}}{D}+\sqrt{\frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp}}{K}}
\end{equation}

As the recombination process becomes fast (\textit{ie} $K \rightarrow \infty$), $c_0 \approx 0$ and $c_\mathrm{max} \approx \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp} R_{p}}{D}$.

Since the main driver for the diffusion is the value $c_\mathrm{max}$, when $R_p$ is negligeable compared to the dimension of the simulation domain, one can simply impose this value at the surface.
% This analytical simplification is especially useful to simulate implanted sources near the surface (\textit{eg} plasma implantation) without having to finely discretise the domain to fully represent the gaussian distribution.
% Such a discretisation can be easily done for 1D simulations but is very complex in 2D and 3D and often makes the mesh very large which increases drastically the computational cost.

A transient solution based on trap properties can be derived \sidecite{hodille_study_2016}:
\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{max}=(\frac{R_p \varphi_\mathrm{imp}}{D} + \sqrt{\frac{\varphi_\mathrm{imp}}{K}}) \cdot \frac{\tau}{t} \cdot\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{t}{\tau}}-1\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is a characteristic time expressed by:
\begin{equation}
    \tau = \frac{R_p \sum R_i \, n_i}{8 \varphi_\mathrm{imp}}
\end{equation}
In this expression, $R_i = (p / (k c_\mathrm{max}) + 1)^{-1}$ represents the maximum filling ratio of the trap $i$ and $n_i$ is the trap density.

\subsection{Interface condition: conservation of chemical potential}
% According to Krom \textit{et al} \sidecite{krom_hydrogen_2000}, since the solubility of hydrogen atoms in solids is low, the chemical potential of solute hydrogen $\mu$ is expressed by:
% \begin{equation}
%     \mu = \mu_0 + RT \ln\left( \frac{c_\mathrm{m}}{N_L}\right)
% \end{equation}
% where $\mu_0$ is the chemical potential in a reference state in \si{J.mol^{-1}}, $R$ the ideal gas constant, $T$ the temperature in \si{K}, $c_\mathrm{m}$ the mobile hydrogen concentration in \si{m^{-3}} and $N_L$ the lattice site concentration in \si{m^{-3}}.

% % Assuming that only free hydrogen atoms contribute to the overall flux in the material, the particle flux $J$ in \si{m^{-2}.s^{-1}} can be expressed by Fick's law:
% % \begin{equation}
% %     J = - D \nabla c_\mathrm{m}
% % \end{equation}
% % where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen expressed in \si{m^{2}.s^{-1}}. 


% The local equilibrium at the interface between two materials must ensure  the continuity of both the chemical potential $\mu$ (see Equation \ref{eq: muconservation}) and the particle flux (see Equation \ref{eq: flux conservation}).
% \begin{equation}
%     \mu^- = \mu^+  \label{eq: muconservation}  
% \end{equation}
    
% \begin{equation}
%     D^- \nabla c_\mathrm{m}^- = D^+ \nabla c_\mathrm{m}^+ \label{eq: flux conservation} 
% \end{equation}

The continuity of chemical potential is conveyed by the continuity of $P$, the local partial pressure of hydrogen at equilibrium.
In a metal, $P$ can be expressed from Sievert's law of solubility:
\begin{equation}
    P = (c_\mathrm{m}^-/S^-)^2
\end{equation}
with $S$ the solubility of H in the materials expressed in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-0.5}}.
% A way to picture the continuity of chemical potential is to imagine a gas layer at the interface between two materials at a partial pressure $P_\mathrm{eq}$.
% $P_\mathrm{eq}$ can be expressed by the solubility law at the surface of each material.
At the interface between two metallic surfaces, the chemical potential continuity is therefore conveyed by the continuity of the quantity $c_\mathrm{m}/S$.:
\begin{equation}
    (c_\mathrm{m}^-/S^-)^2 = (c_\mathrm{m}^+/S^+)^2
\end{equation}

In the case of a metal in contact with a non-metallic liquid behaving according to Henry's law (\textit{eg} a molten salt):
\begin{equation}
    (c_\mathrm{m}^-/S^-)^2 = c_\mathrm{m}^+/S^+
\end{equation}
with $S$ the solubility of H in the materials expressed in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-0.5}} or \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-1}}.

% This assumption is correct as long as the time needed to reach the equilibrium is low compared to the time of the simulation.
% For long exposure time as well as for high temperatures, the characteristic time is small enough for the equilibrium model to be valid (see page \refpage{Interface transient model}).

% From Equation \ref{eq: c/s conservation}, one can deduce that a solubility discontinuity across an interface induces a discontinuity of mobile hydrogen concentration $c_\mathrm{m}$.
% This can also be interpreted as the chemical potentials at a reference state being different in different materials \sidecite{kirchheim_25_2014}, as the lattice site concentration.

FESTIM ensures the continuity of chemical potential by performing a change of variable in Fick's second law of diffusion with $\phi = c_\mathrm{m}/S$ (in the case of a metal) \sidecite{smith_abaqusstandard_2009} when internal conditions cannot be set.
Neglecting the trapping and generation terms, Equation \ref{eq:mobile} therefore reads:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \phi S}{\partial t} &= \nabla \cdot\left(D \nabla \phi S\right) + f \nonumber \\
    &=\nabla \cdot\left( D S \nabla \phi + D \phi \nabla S\right) + f \label{eq: diffusion equation changed}
\end{align}

% Because $\phi$ is computed, the ratio $c_\mathrm{m}/S$ is continuous by default at the material interfaces.

% This second approach is used for instance in the \textit{mass-diffusion} procedure of the Abaqus code \sidecite{smith_abaqusstandard_2009}.
% This interface model has also been implemented into the current hydrogen transport code FESTIM \sidecite{delaporte-mathurin_finite_2019} using FEniCS \sidecite{alnaes_fenics_2015}.

After solving Equation \ref{eq: diffusion equation changed} for $\phi$, $c_m$ can be retrieved by multiplying the solution by $S$.

\section{Heat transfer}
Due to the numerous processes that are thermally activated, it is essential have an accurate temperature field.
Moreover, most tokamak plasma facing components are exposed to intense heat fluxes and are actively cooled, exhibiting high temperature gradients.
The temperature fields are even more complex when dealing with non-trivial geometries like monoblocks or breeding blankets.
For these reasons, heat transfers need to be modelled.

The equation describing heat conduction in solids is described as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \rho \cdot C_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\nabla \cdot (\lambda \nabla T)
    \label{eq:heat equation}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the density of the material in \si{kg.m^{-3}}, $C_p$ its specific heat capacity expressed in \si{J.kg^{-1}.K^{-1}} and $\lambda$ the thermal conductivity expressed in \si{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}.

The thermal properties $C_p$, $\rho$ and $\lambda$ are usually temperature dependent.

For heat transfer problems, three types of boundary conditions can be imposed.

First, the temperature can be fixed on the boundary (see Equation \ref{eq:dirichlet bc T}).
\begin{equation}
    T = T(x, y, z, t) \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq:dirichlet bc T}
\end{equation}
where $\partial \Omega$ is the domain boundary.

On the other hand, a heat flux can also be imposed by enforcing the temperature gradient (see Equation \ref{eq: neumann bc T}).
\begin{equation}
    -\lambda \nabla T \cdot \mathbf{n} = f(x, y, z, t) \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: neumann bc T}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity in \si{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}, $\mathbf{n}$ is the boundary normal vector and $\partial \Omega$ is the domain boundary.

Finally, to model a convective heat flux when the surface is in contact with a fluid (\textit{eg} cooling pipes, natural convection...), a Robin boundary condition needs to be employed (see Equation \ref{eq: convective bc T}).
\begin{equation}
    -\lambda \nabla T \cdot \mathbf{n} = h (T - T_\mathrm{ext}) \quad \text { on } \partial \Omega
    \label{eq: convective bc T}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity in \si{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}, $\mathbf{n}$ is the boundary normal vector, $h$ is the heat exchange coefficient in \si{W.m^{-2}.K^{-1}}, $T_\mathrm{ext}$ is the fluid temperature in \si{K} and $\partial \Omega$ is the domain boundary.
The heat exchange coefficient is usually dependent on the temperature.

\section{Implementation}


The models described in this Section can be hard to solve analytically for complex problems (complex geometries, transients, combined boundary conditions, etc).
The code FESTIM \sidecite{delaporte-mathurin_finite_2019} was therefore developped in order to solve these equations numerically.

\subsection{The finite element method: FEniCS}
FESTIM is based on the Finite Element Method to solve this set of differential equations and boundary conditions.
Several finite element libraries are openly available (deal.II \sidecite{arndt_dealii_2021}, MFEM \sidecite{kolev_tzanio_modular_2010}, MOOSE \sidecite{permann_moose_2020}, FreeFEM++ \sidecite{hecht_new_2012}, ...).
The open-source python package FEniCS \sidecite{alnaes_fenics_2015} was employed.
The finite element method is a versatile tool that can solve any partial differential equation on an arbitrary geometry in 1D, 2D or 3D.
The main advantage of this method compared to the finite difference method is the simplicity of its application to complex geometries and unstructured meshes.
Indeed, implementing a finite difference scheme for such a problem would be tedious and extra care must be taken for mistakes in the implementation could result in losses in efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution.

This section will detail the finite element method applied to a simple diffusion equation (see Equation \ref{eq: example poisson}).

\begin{equation}
    -\nabla^2 u = f
    \label{eq: example poisson}
\end{equation}

The first step of the finite element method is to represent the solution $u$ as a combination of polynomial expressions (see Equation \ref{eq: FEM solution}).

\begin{equation}
    u = \sum^N_{i=0}u_i \phi_i(x, y, z)
    \label{eq: FEM solution}
\end{equation}
where $u_i$ are the coefficient to be determined (called degrees of freedom) and $\phi_i$ are polynomials (see Figure \ref{fig: example approximated solution}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter2/approximated_solution.pdf}
    \caption{Example of an approximated solution $u$ (exact in blue, approximated in orange) with basis functions $\phi_i$}
    \label{fig: example approximated solution}
\end{figure}


The second step is to build a variational formulation (also called weak form) of the governing equation \ref{eq: example poisson}.
To do so, the recipe is to multiply the PDE by a function $v$ (called the test function) and integrate over an arbitrary element $\Omega_e$.
The following expression is obtained:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u v dx = \int_{\Omega_e} f v dx \quad \forall v
    \label{eq: weak form 1}
\end{equation}

When using $N+1$ different test functions, Equation \ref{eq: weak form 1} then gives rise to a system of $N+1$ equations.
This form is called the weak form because it relaxes the requirement of Equation \ref{eq: example poisson} and instead requires to solve Equation \ref{eq: weak form 1} for all test functions.

Equation \ref{eq: weak form 1} needs now to be rewritten in order to only have first order derivatives.
To do so, Gauss-Green's lemma is employed:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u v dx = \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx - \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v dx
    \label{eq: gauss-green}
\end{equation}

The variational form therefore reads:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx = \int_{\Omega_e} f v dx + \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v dx \quad \forall v
    \label{eq: weak form 2}
\end{equation}
where the last term of the equation either vanishes due to Dirichlet boundary conditions or is imposed.

From Equation \ref{eq: weak form 2}, a system of $N+1$ equations can be solved to determine the coefficients $u_i$ in Equation \ref{eq: FEM solution}.
Once the $u_i$ coefficients are known, an approximated solution can be computed.

\subsection{Main features of FESTIM}
FESTIM provides an even higher level of abstraction than FEniCS by providing a user-friendly interface dedicated to H transport and H transfer problems.
Users only have to provide inputs such as material properties, traps properties, geometry, solving parameters, without having to dive into the finite element implementation.

% user friendly
Multi-dimensional transient simulations coupled with heat transfer can therefore be run fairly easily without finite element knowledge.
Nevertheless, since FESTIM is object-oriented, advanced users will always be able to turn FESTIM inside-out to adapt the code to their specific needs (specific boundary conditions, slight changes in the governing equations...).
Since FESTIM is written in python - which is a fairly easy-to-learn programming langage - no advanced level of coding is required.

% physics
As mentioned above, FESTIM simulates the transport (diffusion and trapping) of H and additional physics can be incorporated, such as the Soret effect (also called heat of transport) and conservation of chemical potential at interfaces...
Various types of boundary conditions are available for both the H transport (imposed concentration, recombination flux, dissociation flux, implanted source approximation...) and the heat transfer problems (imposed temperature, imposed flux, convective flux...).
Traps densities in FESTIM can also be time-dependent allowing the users to simulate extrinsic traps (\textit{eg} irradiation induced traps, stress induced traps...).

% geometry
Thanks to the finite element method, geometries used in FESTIM can be complex (see Figure \ref{fig: example mesh}).
The meshing capability of FESTIM is limited to 1D meshes and it was decided to instead make FESTIM accept (with the XDMF format) complex meshes from third-party applications dedicated to meshing such as SALOME or GMSH.
These third-party applications can for instance be usefull to run CAD-based simulations.
Users can also decide to use the FEniCS built-in meshing tool.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter2/example_mesh.png}
    \caption{Example of a complex 3D geometry (here a breeding blanket section) mesh readable by FESTIM \cite{dark_influence_2021}.}
    \label{fig: example mesh}
\end{figure}

% visualisation
Similarly, FESTIM (FEniCS) visualisation functions are limited.
FESTIM is not a graphical application but the files generated by FESTIM (XDMF, CSV, TXT) can easily be read and post-processed by specialised tools such as Paraview \sidecite{ahrens_paraview_2005}, matplotlib \sidecite{hunter_matplotlib_2007}, NumPy \sidecite{harris_array_2020}, etc.

% what FE
Regarding the default finite elements used in FESTIM are Continuous Galerkin elements but it can be switched to Discontinuous Galerkin when needed.
This is usefull when the trapped concentration is discontinuous and help avoiding under- or over-shoots in the concentration field.

% Adaptive step size
When dealing with transient problems, FESTIM provides an adaptive stepsize allowing the stepsize to increase (by a user-defined factor) when the convergence criterion is easily reached by the solver.
This greatly improve the performance of the code since less timesteps are needed.



\section{Verification \& Validation}

Before using the FESTIM code for analysis, it has to be verified and validated.
The verification \& validation process (often called V\&V) has two goals: (1) to prove that the governing equations are correctly solved and that the code is error free and (2) to demonstrate that the governing equations actually reproduce processes observed experimentally.
In other words, verification is answering the question "Are we building the code right?" and validation is answering the question "Are we building the right code?".

This Section details the V\&V of the FESTIM code.

\section{Summary}

The macroscopic rate equations model describing the transport (diffusion and trapping) of H in solids was presented alongside with additional models such as the conservation of chemical potential at interfaces.
Due to the presence of thermally activated processes (diffusion, trapping, detrapping, surface processes, ...), the heat transfer equation has to be solved numerically.
All these equations are solved with the finite element code FESTIM, which heavily relies of FEniCS.

FESTIM has been verified using methods such as the Method of Exact Solutions and the Method of Manufactured Solutions.
On the other hand, it was shown that FESTIM could be employed to reproduce real-life experiments (TDS experiments) performed on Tungsten, Aluminium, Beryllium and EUROFER.
This validation process could be extended by reproducing other types of experiments such as permeation experiments and profilometry.
However, this set of equation (shared amongst H transport codes) has already proven to be capable of reproducing these experiments.
This has been done, for instance, during the validation of TMAP7 \sidecite{longhurst_tmap7_2008}.

Thanks to this verification \& validation process, it was shown that (1) the governing equations were correctly solved and (2) these equations can represent real life processes.

The FESTIM code can then be safely employed to perform analysis on tokamak components.
