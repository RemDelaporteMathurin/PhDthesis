The divertor of a tokamak will not be only exposed to hydrogen.
Components will also be bombarded by high energy helium ions.

This Section will focus on the effect of helium on hydrogen transport.
To this end, a helium bubble growth model has been developed.
Based on the results of this model, experiments investigating the effect of helium transport on hydrogen trapping will be reproduced.
