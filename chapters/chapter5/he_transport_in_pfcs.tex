\section{Summary}

\gls{festim} was used to simulate the influence of helium implantation on hydrogen transport.
The formation of helium bubble in tungsten was first studied.
It was shown that this phenomenon was limited to a small region near the exposed surface.

The experiment of Ialovega and co-workers \sidecite{ialovega_hydrogen_2020} was then reproduced and one possible explanation was given.
Although fitting a \gls{tds} spectrum is not sufficient to draw strong conclusions, this work suggests that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item helium does not leave bubbles in significant quantities at these temperatures
    \item helium occupies pre-existing defects avoiding hydrogen to get trapped
    \item Hydrogen retention is not dominated by helium-induced bubbles but rather by the saturation of pre-existing defects by helium
\end{itemize}

From these results, several experimental suggestions can be made.
Running the \gls{tds} up to \SI{750}{K} only would limit helium desorption.
Indeed, the authors \cite{ialovega_hydrogen_2020} showed that there was no helium desorption below this temperature after the initial cleaning \gls{tds}.
If helium does not desorb and remains in the pre-existing defects, the deuterium \gls{tds} spectra should not be affected and only the desorption from bubbles should be observed.
This would confirm or infirm the interpretation of the results presented herein.

Moreover, if this interpretation was confirmed, it could have implications for hydrogen retention.
Indeed, one could imagine reducing the tritium inventory of components by first exposing them to helium.
Helium would fill the existing defects, making it impossible for tritium to be trapped.
However, having a helium inventory in components can also have negative consequences.
