Now that the code has been verified and solves the governing equations correctly, experimental validation is still required to check that these equations actually represent real life processes.
A very good example of real life experiments that can be reproduced are Thermo-Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) experiments also called Thermally Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiments.
The principle of such experiments is to load small samples with H isotopes (H, D, or T) - either with a gas infusion or via plasma implantation - and heat it up to different temperatures to desorb the trapped H.
By measuring the outgassing flux of particles throughout the time of the experiment, desorption spectra are obtained.
These spectra often exhibit several peaks and each peak correspond to a kind of trap.

This technique is therefore employed to characterise materials and determine what kind of defects can be found in them. 
It is also a very good application case for experimental validation of the H transport model.

This section explains the technique that was employed to easily reproduce these TDS experiments.
Several application cases will also be shown on W, Al, EUROFER, and Be.
