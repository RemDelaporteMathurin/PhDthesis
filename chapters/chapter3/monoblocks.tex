\chapter{Monoblocks}\label{Chapter3}\labch{Chapter3}

In order to assess the behaviour of H in the divertor, component-level simulations of monoblocks are required.

This chapter will focus on simulating H transport in ITER-like monoblocks.

\refsec{model description} will describe the model geometry, the boundary conditions as well as the materials and trap properties.
Then, \refsec{simulation simplifications} will review the simplifications that can be brought to the model to reduce the computation time.
Finally, with these simplifications, a parametric study will be performed and a behaviour law linking the monoblock H inventory to the exposure conditions will be determined in \refsec{influence of exposure conditions}.

\section{Model description}\labsec{model description}

The monoblock geometry is described on \reffig{monoblock geometry}.
The boundary conditions for the heat transfer problem are described in \refeq{bc thermal monoblock} and those for the hydrogen transport problem are described in \refeq{bc H transport monoblock}.
An instantaneous recombination is assumed on the poloidal and toroidal gaps and at the plasma facing surface.
This assumption is consistent with the high recombination coefficient measured by Ogorodnikova \sidecite{ogorodnikova_recombination_2019} compared to Anderl's coefficient \sidecite{anderl_deuterium_1992}.

The materials properties (diffusivity, solubility, and thermal conductivity, density and heat capacity) are described in \reftab{materials properties monoblock} and plotted on \reffig{properties monoblock}.
Finally, the traps properties are described in \reftab{traps monoblock}.
The traps for \gls{W} were taken from \sidecite{hodille_macroscopic_2015} and the trap created by ion implantation is neglected for it only affects the near surface of the monoblock.

\section{Simulation simplifications}\labsec{simulation simplifications}

\subsection{Thermal behaviour}\labsec{monoblock thermal behaviour}
Steady-state heat transfer simulations were performed with FESTIM with varying heat fluxes $\varphi_\mathrm{heat}$.
With $\varphi_\mathrm{heat} = \SI{1}{MW.m^{-2}}$, the surface temperature of the monoblock was found to be around \SI{400}{K} (see \reffig{T field 1 MW}) whereas with $\varphi_\mathrm{heat} = \SI{10}{MW.m^{-2}}$ the surface was around \SI{1400}{K} (see \reffig{T field 10 MW}).

\begin{figure*} [h!]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Thermal behaviour of the monoblock.}
\end{figure*}

The average surface temperature $T_\mathrm{surface}$ therefore increases linearly with the heat load and can be fitted by \refeq{thermal behaviour law} (see \reffig{surface temperature as a function of heat flux}).
\begin{equation}
    T_\mathrm{surface} = 1.1 \times 10^{-4} \cdot \varphi_\mathrm{heat} + T_\mathrm{coolant}
    \labeq{thermal behaviour law}
\end{equation}

This was found to be in very good agreement with experimental measurements performed in \sidecite{hirai_use_2016}.
Using a mean surface temperature had low influence on the hydrogen transport results compared to a non-homogeneous surface temperature that could be obtained with a heat flux condition since surface temperature gradient was low compared to the one between the top surface and the cooling surface.

\subsection{Influence of dimensionality}\labsec{influence of dimensionality}

The first simplification that can be done is the dimensionality.
A full 3D simulation would be the most accurate, but also the most expensive in terms of computation time (partly because more cells are required for the same spatial discretisation as seen on \reffig{monoblock meshes}).
Conversely, 1D simulations are faster to run, but are less accurate.
This is sometimes referred as the \textit{curse of dimensionality}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.27\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter3/monoblocks/mesh_3d.png}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Meshes used for the monoblock simulations.}
    \labfig{monoblock meshes}
\end{figure}

A 2D approximation assumes the solution is independent of the poloidal direction.
The hydrogen inventory is obtained by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{inv} = e \int_\Omega (c_\mathrm{m} + \sum c_\mathrm{t,\, i}) \, dS
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the monoblock thickness.

Similarly, the 1D approximation assumes the solution is independent of both the poloidal and the toroidal direction (see \reffig{dimension approximations monoblock}).
It also cannot capture the full geometry of the monoblock as it would assume Cu and CuCrZr slabs instead of hollow cylinders.
The hydrogen inventory is obtained by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{inv} = e \, L \int_\Omega (c_\mathrm{m} + \sum c_\mathrm{t,\, i}) \, dl
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the monoblock width.

    \caption{Representation of the 2D and 1D approximations on a monoblock geometry. The arrows represent geometry independencies.}
    \labfig{dimension approximations monoblock}
\end{figure}

Monoblocks simulations were run in 1D, 2D, and 3D and the inventory was computed for each case (see \reffig{monoblock inventories 1d 2d 3d}).
Both the 1D and 2D approximations overestimate the inventory compared to the 3D reference, these approximations are therefore conservative.
It should however be noticed that, when neglecting the recombination on the poloidal gap (i.e.\ assuming hydrogen cannot desorb from this surface), the 2D approximation is strictly equivalent to the 3D reference (see \ref{DEMO monoblocks}).
For these reasons, the 2D approximation will be employed in the following sections as it is the best compromise between accuracy and computational time.

\subsection{Influence of interface condition}\labsec{influence of interface conditions}
\input{chapters/chapter3/monoblocks/interface_conditions}

\subsection{Influence of cycling}\labsec{influence of cycling}

In ITER, the plasma operation will not be continuous.
Instead, pulses of \SI{600}{s} will be shot \sidecite{lister_plasma_2006} with a ramp-up of \SI{100}{s}, a plateau during \SI{400}{s}, a ramp-down of \SI{100}{s} and \SI{1000}{s} of dwell time between pulses (see \reffig{plasma cycle}).
Simulating these transient cycles would require stepsizes of $\approx \SI{10}{s}$ in order to capture the ramp-up and ramp-down phases.
Simulating one cycle would therefore require more than 60 steps (excluding the resting phase).

On the other hand, FESTIM has an adaptive stepsize feature allowing the stepsize to increase (resp. decrease) when steps are solved in less (resp. more) than five Newton iterations.
Therefore, if a continuous plasma exposure was simulated, the adaptive stepsize would allow the stepsize to increase up to thousands of seconds, reducing a lot the simulation time.

To verify the validity of the continuous exposure approximation, 1D simulations were run with plasma cycles or continuous exposure.
For the cycled simulation, both the heat flux $\varphi_\mathrm{heat}$ and the particle flux $\varphi_\mathrm{imp}$ were varied from zero during the resting phases to their nominal values during the plateau phase (see \reffig{plasma cycle}).

Two cases were run:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High flux: $\varphi_\mathrm{heat} = \SI{13}{MW.m^{-2}}$ and $\varphi_\mathrm{imp} = \SI{1.6e22}{m^{-2}.s^{-1}}$
    \item Low flux: $\varphi_\mathrm{heat} = \SI{5}{MW.m^{-2}}$ and $\varphi_\mathrm{imp} = \SI{5.0e21}{m^{-2}.s^{-1}}$
\end{itemize}

In the high flux case, the surface temperature is about $\SI{1400}{K}$ during the plateau whereas it is only $\approx \SI{500}{K}$ for the low flux case.
The evolution of the inventory for both cases was calculated with or without cycling (see \reffig{monoblock inventory cycling}).
To be able to compare the cases, the inventory is shown as a function of the fluence:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{fluence}(t) = \int_0^t \varphi_\mathrm{imp}(t) \, dt
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter3/monoblocks/cycle.pdf}
    \caption{ITER plasma cycle. Evolution of heat flux and implanted particle flux.}
    \labfig{plasma cycle}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter3/monoblocks/comparison_inventory_cycling.pdf}
    \caption{Evolution of the monoblock inventory as a function of the implanted fluence for cycled (solid) and continuous (dashed) exposure.}
    \labfig{monoblock inventory cycling}
\end{figure}

For the continuous cases, the inventory evolves as a power law of the fluence.
For the cycled simulations, spikes appear periodically (between every cycle).
These spikes correspond to ramp-down and ramp-ups during the cycles (see \reffig{monoblock inventory one cycle}).
During the ramp-down, as the temperature decreases, the traps filling ratio increases, which results in an increase in the inventory.
During the resting phase (not shown on \reffig{monoblock inventory cycling} since the flux is null), the inventory is kept constant.
During the ramp-up, the temperature increases again and the hydrogen trapped close to the plasma-facing surface is desorbed and diffuses either back to the plasma, or deeper into the bulk.
Finally, during the plateau phase, the inventory increases as a power law of the fluence.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter3/monoblocks/inventory_one_cycle.pdf}
    \caption{Evolution of the monoblock inventory during the sixth cycle for the high flux case.}
    \labfig{monoblock inventory one cycle}
\end{figure}

These kinetics are observed for both the low flux and high flux cases.
However, in the low flux case, the height of the spikes is greatly reduced.
This is explained by the lower temperature difference between the resting phase and the plateau phase.

In both cases, the evolution trends are the same with or without cycling and the inventory evolution during the plateau phases match the continuous case.
These results are consistent with the one observed in \sidecite{hodille_modelling_2021} with other trapping parameters.
For a monoblock where the flux is even lower and the temperature difference is almost zero, no spikes will appear, and the cycled and continuous cases will match.

Moreover, the ``height'' of these spikes is constant.
This means that, after more cycles, these spikes will become negligible compared to the bulk inventory.
For the high flux case, the inventory spike will be negligible (10\% of the total inventory) after approximately 4000 cycles.
For the low flux case, it is negligible after only 1150 cycles.

This therefore validates the continuous exposure simplification.


\section{Monoblock behaviour law}\labsec{influence of exposure conditions}

\input{chapters/chapter3/monoblocks/parametric_study}

\section{Summary}
H transport in ITER-like monoblocks was simulated with FESTIM.

The validity of various simplifications and assumptions was first studied.
A relationship between the average surface temperature and the heat flux was obtained.
It was then shown that the choice of interface conditions (continuity of chemical potential or continuity of mobile concentration) had low impact on the monoblock inventory.
Moreover, the 2D approximation was found to be the best compromise between accuracy of the solution and computational time.
The effect of loading cycles was also investigated.
Between plasma pulses, a zone with higher retention appears near the plasma exposed surface due to the temperature variation.
These modifications of the retention fields vanish as soon as the next cycle starts again and this zone is heated up again.
This means that cycling has no effect on the global retention field and that cycles can safely be concatenated (continuous exposure) to simulate H transport.

A parametric study was then performed in order to assess the influence of exposure conditions (surface concentration and surface temperature).
A behaviour law was obtained correlating exposure conditions to the monoblock inventory at a given exposure time.
This law will be extremely useful to estimate H retention in divertors in \refch{Divertor inventory estimation} since not all monoblocks will be exposed to the same exposure.
