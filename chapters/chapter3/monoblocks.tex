\chapter{Monoblocks}\label{Chapter3}\labch{Chapter3}

\section{Introduction}
ITER and DEMO divertors will be composed of small unit bricks called \textit{monoblocks} (see Figure \ref{fig: inner target photo}).
Monoblocks are typically made of a tungsten substrate with a cooling pipe running through.
This cooling channel is necessary to keep the component's temperature below its operating limit.

Several monoblock designs are currently studied for DEMO with varying dimensions, different materials for the cooling pipe or the interlayer, etc \sidecite{vizvary_european_2020, huang_tungsten_2016, hirai_use_2016, domptail_design_2020}.
The main candidate is the ITER-like design, which is the type of monoblock that will be used in ITER \cite{hirai_use_2016}.
This design has a tunsgten substrate with a CuCrZr cooling pipe and a Cu interlayer for compliance (see Figure \ref{fig: monoblocks with pipe}).
In ITER, monoblocks will be \SI{12}{mm}-thick whereas they will be thiner in DEMO (\SI{4}{mm}) \sidecite{you_european_2018}.

In order to assess the behaviour of H in the divertor, component-level simulations of monoblocks are required.

This chapter will focus on simulating H transport in ITER-like monoblocks.
First, the influence of interface conditions at the W/Cu and Cu/CuCrZr interfaces will be evaluated.
% Then, the impact of load cycling (heat and particles fluxes) will be assessed.
A parametric study will then be performed to link the monoblock H inventory to the exposure conditions.
Finally, the influence of edge effects (desorption on poloidal and toroidal gaps) will be highlighted.

\section{Summary}
H transport in ITER-like monoblocks was simulated with FESTIM.
Several aspects of the simulations were studied.

It was shown that the choice of interface conditions (continuity of chemical potential or continuity of mobile concentration) had low impact on the monoblock inventory.
Depending on the boundary condition used at the cooling surface of the monoblock, it could however have an impact on the permeation flux.

The effect of loading cycles was also investigated.
Between plasma pulses, a zone with higher retention appears near the plasma exposed surface due to the temperature variation.
These modifications of the retention fields vanish as soon as the next cycle starts again and this zone is heated up again.
This means that cycling has no effect on the global retention field and that cycles can safely be concatenated (continuous exposure) to simulate H transport.

A parametric study was then performed in order to assess the influence of exposure conditions (surface concentration and surface temperature).
A 2D behaviour law was obtained correlating exposure conditions to the monoblock inventory.
This law will be extremely useful to estimate H retention in divertors since not all monoblocks will be exposed to the same exposure.

Finally, 3D simulations of DEMO ITER-like monoblocks have been run.
The desorption on the poloidal and toroidal gaps drastically reduced the inventory while increasing the outgassing flux to the vacuum chamber.
The permeation flux to the coolant decreased.
This means that 2D simulations are conservative in terms of H inventory.
This however undersestimates outgassing fluxes.
Future work should involve refining the behaviour law obtained in Section \ref{influence of exposure conditions} by running new 3D simulations and compute not only the H inventory but also the total outgassing.
