\chapter{Monoblocks}
\section{Introduction}
ITER and DEMO divertors will be composed of monoblocks (see Figure \ref{fig: inner target photo}).
Typically, monoblocks are made of a tungsten substrate with a cooling pipe running through.
This cooling channel is necessary to keep the component's temperature below its operating limit.


Several monoblock designs are currently studied for DEMO with varying dimensions, different materials for the cooling pipe or the interlayer, etc.
The main candidate is the ITER-like design (the type of monoblock that will be used in ITER).
This design has a tunsgten substrate with a CuCrZr cooling pipe and a Cu interlayer for compliance (see Figure \ref{fig: monoblocks with pipe}).
In ITER, monoblocks will be \SI{12}{mm}-thick whereas they will be thiner in DEMO (\SI{4}{mm}).

In order to assess the behaviour of H in the divertor, component-level simulations of monoblocks are required.

This chapter will focus on simulating H transport in ITER-like monoblocks in 2D.
First, the influence of interface conditions at the W/Cu and Cu/CuCrZr interfaces will be evaluated.
Then, the impact of load cycling (heat and particles fluxes) will be assessed.
A parametric study will then be performed to link the monoblock H inventory to the exposure conditions.
Finally, the 3D edge effects will be highlighted.
