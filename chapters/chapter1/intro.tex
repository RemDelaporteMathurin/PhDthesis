\subsection{He/H}
Lee \textit{et al} studied the influence of He implantation on D retention.
They showed with ERD depth profiles (up to 40 nm) that D is trapped where He is trapped and proposed that He bubbles produce secondary defects around them which can trap D \cite{lee_hydrogen_2007}.
These defects can be interstitial loops produced by loop punching.
Lee \textit{et al} also suggested that no evidence had been found on trapping of D by chemisorption on the inner surface of a He bubble nor by molecular interaction with the He cluster.
The privileged mechanism is therefore the trapping of D in the defects made by the stress field induced by the He bubble to the crystalline structure of the W.

It has been shown by Ueda \textit{et al} that He implantation (even in small amounts) greatly affects H blistering in W \cite{ueda_simultaneous_2009}.
With only 0.1\% of He in the ion beam one can observe that H blistering is completely suppressed for temperature greater than \SI{653}{K}.
At lower temperature, H blistering occurs but is reduced significantly.
This phenomena is due to the fact that H migration to the bulk and accumulation at grain boundaries is avoided by He bubbles at the near surface which act as a diffusion plug for H.
The same phenomena has been observed by Miyamoto \textit{et al} \cite{miyamoto_microscopic_2011} which contributes to reducing H retention.
Markelj \textit{et al} \cite{markelj_hydrogen_2017} shown however that He implantation does increase D retention in the He clustering zone.
This implies that observed reduction or increase of D retention in mixed H-He plasma experiment are depending on the depth of implantation.
