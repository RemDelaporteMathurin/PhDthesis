\subsection{Principle: the DT reaction}

The fundamental principle of nuclear fusion is to fuse two light nuclei into a heavier nucleus.
The mass difference between the products and the reactants is released in the form of energy (see Equation \ref{eq: emc2}).
\begin{equation}
    E = \Delta m c^2
    \label{eq: emc2}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta m$ is the mass difference, $c$ is the speed of light.
This process is the opposite process of nuclear fission, powering the current nuclear plants.

When looking at the different binding energies per nucleon of the elements (see Figure \ref{fig: binding energy per nucleon}), it becomes clear that light elements release energy from fusion and heavy elements release energy from fission.

Nuclei are positively charged.
To be able to fuse, these must overcome the Coulomb barrier induced by the electromagnetic repulsion (see Figure \ref{fig: potential energy diagram fusion}).
This Coulomb barrier increases with the charge of the nuclei (\textit{ie} the number of protons).
This means that the nuclei must collide with a high enough velocity.
At the atomistic scale, the velocity $v_\mathrm{th}$ is a function of temperature (see Equation \ref{eq: thermal velocity}).
This is one of the reasons why the probability of a fusion reaction (called cross-section) is temperature dependent.

\begin{equation}
    v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{m}}
    \label{eq: thermal velocity}
\end{equation}
where $k_B = \SI{1.3806e-23}{m^2.s^{-2}.kg.K^{-1}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the nucleus temperature in \si{K} and $m$ is the nucleus mass in \si{kg}.

Since hydrogen is the lightest element, it has the lowest fusion temperature.

         \ce{^2H + ^2H -> ^3He + n}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \ce{^2H + ^2H -> ^4He + n}

\subsection{Tokamaks: how to bottle a star}

\subsubsection{Technology}
A these temperatures, the DT gas becomes a plasma where electrons are teared out from the nuclei.
The principle of magnetic confinement reactors is to trap the electrically charged particles in a magnetic cages.
The electrons and ions will gyrate around the magnetic field lines.
The Larmor radius of the gyration is given by:
\begin{equation}
    R =  \frac{\sqrt{2 m T}}{e B}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $T$ its temperature, $e$ its charge and $B$ the magnetic field.
In a hot plasma (\SI{10}{keV}) with a strong magnetic field of \SI{3}{T}, the Larmor radius of ions is $\approx \SI{1}{mm}$, which is much smaller compared to the size of a reactor.
The Larmor radius of an electron is orders of magnitude smaller due to its lower mass.
Straight magnetic lines can therefore confine charged particles in the direction perpendicular to the field lines.
The particles are however not confined in the parrallel direction.

This issue is simply solved by closing the field lines, forming a torus-shaped magnetic field.
However, this configuration poses another problem: bending the field lines creates a magnetic field gradient in the radial direction.
This magnetic field gradient and the centrifugal force cause the particles to drift upwards (or downwards depending on their charge).
Due to this drift, the particles end up escaping the magnetic confinement until they touch the walls of the chamber and neutralise (making it impossible for them to fuse).

Two options exist to compensate this drift.
The first is to add a poloidal component to the magnetic field and twist the magnetic lines.
This is done by inducting a current in the plasma thanks to a central solenoïd (see Figure~\ref{fig:tokamak magnetic field}).
This configuration is called Tokamak which stands for "toroidalnaïa kamera s magnitnymi katouchkami" (toroidal chamber with magnetic coils).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/tokamak_magnetic_fields.png}
    \caption{Magnetic field lines in a tokamak. Contribution of the toroidal and poloidal components.}
    \label{fig:tokamak magnetic field}
\end{figure}

The second option is to twist the magnetic field by twisting the toroidal coils themselves.
This configuration is called a stellarator and has the advantage of not having an induced current and is therefore inherently steady-state.
The tokamak, on the other hand, is a pulsed device.
This is because the central solenoid has a limited capacity.
The main drawback of the the stellarator is the complexity of the coils.
Since each coil has a unique shape, the cost of manufacturing such a reactor is higher than tokamaks for which coils can be manufactured in serial.

\subsection{He/H}
Lee \textit{et al} studied the influence of He implantation on D retention.
They showed with ERD depth profiles (up to 40 nm) that D is trapped where He is trapped and proposed that He bubbles produce secondary defects around them which can trap D \cite{lee_hydrogen_2007}.
These defects can be interstitial loops produced by loop punching.
Lee \textit{et al} also suggested that no evidence had been found on trapping of D by chemisorption on the inner surface of a He bubble nor by molecular interaction with the He cluster.
The privileged mechanism is therefore the trapping of D in the defects made by the stress field induced by the He bubble to the crystalline structure of the W.

It has been shown by Ueda \textit{et al} that He implantation (even in small amounts) greatly affects H blistering in W \cite{ueda_simultaneous_2009}.
With only 0.1\% of He in the ion beam one can observe that H blistering is completely suppressed for temperature greater than \SI{653}{K}.
At lower temperature, H blistering occurs but is reduced significantly.
This phenomena is due to the fact that H migration to the bulk and accumulation at grain boundaries is avoided by He bubbles at the near surface which act as a diffusion plug for H.
The same phenomena has been observed by Miyamoto \textit{et al} \cite{miyamoto_microscopic_2011} which contributes to reducing H retention.
Markelj \textit{et al} \cite{markelj_hydrogen_2017} shown however that He implantation does increase D retention in the He clustering zone.
This implies that observed reduction or increase of D retention in mixed H-He plasma experiment are depending on the depth of implantation.
