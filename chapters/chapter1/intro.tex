"\textit{I would put my money on the sun! What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.}" Thomas Edison once said.
The use of fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) has allowed the modern human civilisation to reach its current standard of living.
However, their intensive use led to astronomical carbon dioxyde (CO2) emissions.
Since Edison died in 1931, 1500 billion tonnes of CO2 have been emitted on Earth from burning fossil fuels and about 33 bilion tonnes of CO2 are still being released every year \cite{friedlingstein_global_2021}.
The consequence of these emissions is global warming and these CO2 emissions must stop in order to limit it to an "acceptable" level - regardless of the remaining oil and coal reserves.
Reducing the CO2 emissions implies reducing the world energy consumption while developping clean sources of energy.
It is very unlikely that these new sources will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.
They would however act as a shock absorber in the energy crisis mankind is facing.

When looking at the Sun, Edison saw how massive and inexhaustible its energy was.
The process powering the stars is called \textit{nuclear fusion}.
It does not release any greenhouse gases, it is energetically dense and its fuel is abundant on Earth.
Could it be one of these new sources of energy?

\section{Thermonuclear fusion}

The fundamental principle of nuclear fusion is to fuse two light nuclei into a heavier nucleus.
The mass difference between the products and the reactants is released in the form of energy (see Equation \ref{eq: emc2}).
\begin{equation}
    E = \Delta m c^2
    \label{eq: emc2}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta m$ is the mass difference, $c$ is the speed of light.
This process is the opposite process of nuclear fission, powering the current nuclear plants.

When looking at the different binding energies per nucleon of the elements (see Figure \ref{fig: binding energy per nucleon}), it becomes clear that light elements release energy from fusion and heavy elements release energy from fission.

\begin{figure} [h]

    \caption{Binding energy per nucleon \cite{kohn-seemann_alfkoehnfusion_plots_2021}}
    \label{fig: binding energy per nucleon}
\end{figure}

Nuclei are positively charged.
To be able to fuse, these must overcome the Coulomb barrier induced by the electromagnetic repulsion (see Figure \ref{fig: potential energy diagram fusion}).
This Coulomb barrier increases with the charge of the nuclei (\textit{ie} the number of protons).
This means that the nuclei must collide with a high enough velocity.
At the atomistic scale, the velocity $v_\mathrm{th}$ is a function of temperature (see Equation \ref{eq: thermal velocity}).
This is one of the reasons why the probability of a fusion reaction (called cross-section) is temperature dependent.

\begin{equation}
    v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{m}}
    \label{eq: thermal velocity}
\end{equation}
where $k_B = \SI{1.3806e-23}{m^2.s^{-2}.kg.K^{-1}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the nucleus temperature in \si{K} and $m$ is the nucleus mass in \si{kg}.

    \label{fig: potential energy diagram fusion}
\end{figure}

Hydrogen, as the lightest element, has the lowest fusion temperature.
It is also the most abundant element on Earth (although bond to other elements).
Depending on which hydrogen isotope is used, different fusion reactions are available (see Equations \ref{eq: fusion reactions}).
Each of these reactions has a different cross-section.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
         \ce{^2H + ^2H -> ^3H (\SI{1.01}{MeV}) + n (\SI{3.02}{MeV})}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \ce{^2H + ^2H -> ^3He (\SI{0.82}{MeV}) + n (\SI{2.45}{MeV})}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \ce{^2H + ^3H -> ^4He (\SI{3.5}{MeV}) + n (\SI{14.1}{MeV})}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \ce{^2H + ^3He -> ^4He (\SI{3.6}{MeV}) + p (\SI{14.7}{MeV})}
    \end{equation}
    \label{eq: fusion reactions}
\end{subequations}

    \label{fig: fusion cross sections}
\end{figure}

The deuterium-tritium (DT) reaction is the one with the highest cross-section (probability) at "low" temperature (see Figure \ref{fig: fusion cross sections}).
This is the reason why this reaction has been the focus of nuclear fusion for decades.
More recently, private companies have started experimenting with more exotic reactions like proton-boron (TAE Technologies) or D-He3 (Helion Energy).

\section{Tokamaks: how to bottle a star}

\subsection{Technology}
As explained above, for fusion to occur, the fuel must be heated up to millions of degrees.
A these temperatures, the DT gas becomes a plasma where electrons are teared out from the nuclei.
The principle of magnetic confinement reactors is to trap the electrically charged particles in a magnetic cage.
The electrons and ions then gyrate around the magnetic field lines and the Larmor radius of the gyration is given by:
\begin{equation}
    R =  \frac{\sqrt{2 m T}}{e B}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $T$ its temperature, $e$ its charge and $B$ the magnetic field.
In a hot plasma (\SI{10}{keV}) with a strong magnetic field of \SI{3}{T}, the Larmor radius of ions is $\approx \SI{1}{mm}$, which is much smaller compared to the size of a reactor.
The Larmor radius of an electron is orders of magnitude smaller due to its lower mass.
Straight magnetic lines can therefore confine charged particles in the direction perpendicular to the field lines.
However, the particles are not confined in the parrallel direction.

This issue can be solved by closing the field lines, forming a torus-shaped magnetic field.
However, this configuration poses another problem: bending the field lines creates a magnetic field gradient in the radial direction.
This magnetic field gradient and the centrifugal force cause the particles to drift upwards (or downwards depending on their charge).
Due to this drift, the particles end up escaping the magnetic confinement until they touch the walls of the chamber and neutralise (making it impossible for them to fuse).

Two options exist to compensate this drift.
The first is to add a poloidal component to the magnetic field and twist the magnetic lines.
This is done by inducting a current in the plasma thanks to a central solenoïd (see Figure~\ref{fig:tokamak magnetic field}).
This configuration is called Tokamak which stands for "toroidalnaïa kamera s magnitnymi katouchkami" (toroidal chamber with magnetic coils).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/tokamak_magnetic_fields.png}
    \caption{Magnetic field lines in a tokamak. Contribution of the toroidal and poloidal components.}
    \label{fig:tokamak magnetic field}
\end{figure}

The second option is to twist the magnetic field by twisting the toroidal coils themselves.
This configuration is called a stellarator and has the advantage of not having an induced current and is therefore inherently steady-state.
The tokamak, on the other hand, is a pulsed device.
This is because the central solenoid has a limited capacity.
The main drawback of the the stellarator is the complexity of the coils.
Since each coil has a unique shape, the cost of manufacturing such a reactor is higher than tokamaks for which coils can be manufactured in serial.

\subsection{Triple product}
The power balance in a fusion reactor is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = P_\mathrm{fusion} + P_\mathrm{heating} - P_\mathrm{losses}
    \label{eq: plasma energy balance}
\end{equation}
$W$ is the thermal energy stored in the plasma and can be expressed in \si{J.m^{-3}} by:
\begin{equation}
    W = 3 n T
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the plasma density in \si{m^{-3}} and $T$ is the plasma temperature in \si{eV}.
$P_\mathrm{fusion}$, expressed in \si{W.m^{-3}}, is the power generated from fusion reactions themselves and can be expressed by:
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{fusion} = n_D n_T \left\langle \sigma \right\rangle E
\end{equation}
where $n_D$ and $n_T$ are the densities in \si{m^{-3}} of deuterium and tritium respectively, $\left\langle \sigma \right\rangle$ is the DT cross-section in \si{m^3.s^{-1}} and $E$ is the energy of the fusion reaction in \si{J}.
Because the neutrons have little interaction with the plasma, $E \approx E_\alpha = \SI{3.56}{MeV}$.
Moreover, assuming a 50\%-50\% mixture of deuterieum and tritium, $n_D = n_T = \frac{1}{2} n$.
The fusion power can therefore be written as:
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{fusion} = \frac{1}{4} n^2 \left\langle \sigma \right\rangle E_\alpha
\end{equation}

The amplification factor $Q$ defines the ratio of the fusion power by the heating power.
The heating power $P_\mathrm{heating}$ is therefore written as:
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{heating} = \frac{P_\mathrm{fusion}}{Q}
\end{equation}

Finally, $P_\mathrm{losses}$ is the rate at which the plasma loses energy, either by losing mass (particles escaping the magnetic cage) or by radiation.
It is characterised by an energy confinement time $\tau_E$ and can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{losses} = \frac{W}{\tau_E} = \frac{3 n T}{\tau_E}
\end{equation}

Assuming energy equilibrium (\textit{ie} $\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = 0$), Equation \ref{eq: plasma energy balance} can therefore be written as:
\begin{align}
    P_\mathrm{losses} &= P_\mathrm{fusion} + P_\mathrm{heating} \\
    \Leftrightarrow \frac{3 n T}{\tau_E} &= \frac{1}{4} n^2 \left\langle \sigma \right\rangle E_\alpha + \frac{P_\mathrm{fusion}}{Q}
\end{align}

Re-arranging the terms, one can obtain:
\begin{equation}
    n T \tau_E = \frac{12 T^2}{\left\langle \sigma \right\rangle E_\alpha} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{Q}}
    \label{eq: triple product}
\end{equation}

$n T \tau_E$ is known as the \textit{triple product}, a figure of merit describing the performance of a fusion reactor.
Equation \ref{eq: triple product} gives the triple-product required to achieve a given amplification factor $Q$ at a given temperature $T$.

When $P_\mathrm{heating}$ approaches zero (\textit{ie} the auxilliary heating systems are shut down), the amplification factor $Q$ approaches $\infty$.
Therefore:
\begin{equation}
    n T \tau_E \rightarrow \frac{12 T^2}{\left\langle \sigma \right\rangle E_\alpha}
    \label{eq: triple product infinity}
\end{equation}

The quantity $T^2/\langle \sigma \rangle$ has a minimum around $T=\SI{14}{keV}$.
Furthermore, when $\SI{10}{keV} < T < \SI{20}{keV}$, the DT reactivity can be approximated by $\langle \sigma \rangle \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-24} T^2$.

Equation \ref{eq: triple product infinity} can therefore be written as:
\begin{equation}
    n T \tau_E \geq \SI{3e21}{keV.s.m^{-3}}
\end{equation}

This is known as the Lawson criterion, which needs to be satisfied in order to reach \textit{ignition} ($Q = \infty$).


Fusion devices can therefore be classified into three categories.
Stars like our Sun have very high confinement times and densities while remaining at relatively low temperatures (the sun Core is at \SI{1.2}{keV}).
Magnetic confinement devices (tokamaks, stellarators, etc.) exhibit temperatures orders of magnitude higher than stars but have confinement times of the order of $\sim \SI{1}{s}$.
A third way of achieving fusion is to heat and compress a target of fuel with either lasers (NIF, Laser Mega Joule), pistons (General Fusion) or by smashing it at high speed with a projectile (First Light Fusion).
These devices, known as \textit{inertial fusion devices}, exhibit extremely high densities ($\sim \SI{e31}{m^{-3}}$) but short confinement times ($\sim \SI{e-11}{s}$).
 
So far, no fusion device has been able to even reach \textit{break-even} ($Q = 1$) (see Figure \ref{fig: triple product vs T}).
The record of $Q = 0.68$ by the European tokamak JET (Joint European Torus) and was performed in 1997.
The objective of the ITER tokamak, currently under construction in France, is to demonstrate an amplification factor of $Q=10$ over \SI{400}{s}. 
Other designs aim at demonstrating plasma gain (\textit{ie} $Q > 1$) sooner than ITER and at a smaller scale.
This is the case of SPARC and ARC developed by Commonwealth Fusion Systems and MIT \sidecite{sorbom_arc_2015,creely_overview_2020}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Plasma-facing materials}

The walls of a fusion reactor are exposed to intense heat and particle fluxes.
The choice of plasma-facing materials (PFM) is therefore crucial.

A good PFM must have good thermal properties to withstand the extreme heat fluxes.
A high thermal conductivity is required as well as a very high melting point.
The material must also resist to thermal chocs encountered during short plasma discharges or transient events in the plasma \sidecite{van_den_kerkhof_impact_2021}.

In order to maximise the components lifespan, PFMs must resist erosion.
This is even more important when the eroded particle reduce plasma performances by making it radiate and cool.

The choice of a PFM is also important from the nuclear safety point of view.
First, the quantity of tritium retained in the materials need to be minimised (see point will be detailed in Section \ref{the tritium issue}).
Second, neutron activation of the material can increase the quantity of radioactive waste and must be minimised.

One of the first PFM was carbon fiber composite (CFC).
CFC had the great advantage of not melting and withstand very high heat fluxes.
Using CFC also increased the plasma performances greatly.
Unfortunately, graphite being porous, hydrogen (and therefore tritium) retention was high.
Plus carbon can react with plasma particles forming methane.
Methane is then deposited on locations hard to access in the reactor trapping tritium even more.
For these two safety reasons, CFC was replaced with tungsten or beryllium (or both).

Tungsten has a very high melting point (\SI{3422}{°C}) and retains less tritium.
However, tungsten being a high-Z element, eroded tungsten in the form of dust particles or powder will make the plasma radiate and cool it down.
For this reason, the ITER divertor will be made of tungsten but the first wall (which has a large surface area) will be made of beryllium.

\section{The tritium issue} \label{the tritium issue}

\subsection{Breeding}
Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
Its half-life is approximately 12 years and it decays into helium-3 emitting a beta particle of \SI{0.018590}{MeV}.
For this reason, tritium is very rare on Earth.
The current reserve of tritium in the world is a few dozens of kilograms.
It is naturally produced by interaction of comsic rays with the nitrogen in the atmosphere (\SI{0.2}{kg} per year).
Tritium is however produced in larger quantities in fission CANDU reactors as a by-product (\SI{130}{g} per year per CANDU reactor \sidecite{ni_tritium_2013}).

ITER itself will consume around \SI{18}{kg} of tritium over the duration of its operation \sidecite{glugla_iter_2007}, which represent a yearly consumption of \SI{0.9}{kg} for a 20-year lifetime.
A \SI{800}{MWe} DEMO-type commercial fusion reactor would burn around \SI{300}{g} of tritium per day ($\approx \SI{100}{kg}$ a year).

For all these reasons, tritium must be produced on-site in large quantities for a fusion economy to be possible.

To this end, the neutrons of the DT fusion reactions will be harnessed in a component called the \textit{breeding blanket} containing lithium (Li).
Depending on the Li isotope, two reactions can occur:

\begin{align}
    \text{n} + \text{\textsuperscript{6}Li}  \ \ &\xrightarrow{} \ \ \text{\textsuperscript{3}H} + \alpha + \SI{4.8}{MeV}\\
    \text{n} + \text{\textsuperscript{7}Li}  \ \ &\xrightarrow{} \ \ \text{\textsuperscript{3}H} + \alpha + \text{n}' - \SI{2.5}{MeV} 
\end{align}

Several blankets designs have been proposed divided in three main categories: ceramic concepts, liquid metal concepts, and molten-salts concepts.
All designs differ in the choice of tritium breeder, coolant and geometry.

The european candidates for breeding blankets in DEMO are the Water-Cooled-Lithium-Lead (WCLL), the Helium-Cooled-Pebble-Bed (HCPB), the Helium-Cooled-Liquid-Lead (HCLL) and the Dual-Coolant-Lithium-Lead (cooled by water and helium).

Hydrogen transport in these components is key for retention of tritium in solid parts of the blankets could reduce their performances as it would be hard to recover it.
A high retention in the blanket would also lead to a high startup inventory (\textit{ie} the inventory needed when commissioning the fusion power plant) making fusion energy more expensive.

\subsection{Safety}
Tritium is also an issue in terms of nuclear safety.
As a radioactive isotope, its ingestion is a health hazard.
To limit the potential environmental releases due to a loss of vacuum accident, its inventory in fusion reactors must be controlled \sidecite{honda_analyses_2000}.
In ITER for instance, the in-vessel inventory of tritium is limited to \SI{1}{kg}.
As tritium can migrate in materials, components that have been in contact with it are considered as tritiated waste and must be handled.
Tritium migration through complete material layers (permeation) to the cooling tubes or the atmosphere can lead to contamination of coolants and must be taken into account in the detritiation process.

Permeation barriers are being studied to greatly reduce the permeation of tritium to the coolants \sidecite{causey_416_2012,utili_design_2022,utili_development_2021}.
The idea is to coat inner and/or outer surfaces of cooling pipes with alumina-based coatings.
These coatings can also act as an anti-corrosion barrier.

\section{Plasma-surface interactions in tokamaks}

The wall of a fusion reactor (first wall and divertor) is bombarded with high energy hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) and helium ions.
Due to their small size, these ions can penetrate the metal lattice and be implanted in the material.

Many interactions occur between hydrogen, helium and tungsten atoms.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Diffusion}
Diffusion of solute species is thermally activated and the diffusion coefficient $D$ expressed in \si{m^2.s^{-1}} usually follows an Arrhenius law:
\begin{equation}
    D = D_0 \exp{(-E_D/k_B T)}
\end{equation}

% MD simulations
Diffusion coefficients (also called diffusivities) can be computed by Molecular Dynamics (MD).
The principle of Molecular Dynamics is to calculate the trajectory of atoms in a simulation box (see Figure \ref{fig: md faney}).
The trajectory of a particle $i$ in a system of $N$ particles can be computed from Newton's second law of motion:

\begin{equation}
    m_i \vec{a_i} = \sum_{j=1 \, j \neq i}^N \vec{F}_{i,j}
\end{equation}
where $m_i$ is the mass of the particle, $\vec{a_i}$ is its acceleration, $\vec{F}_{i,j}$ is the force applied to the particle due to its interaction with particle $j$.
The forces between atoms is only a function of the interatomic potentials that can be estimated from \textit{ab initio} computations (Density Functional Theory) \sidecite{connetable_diffusion_2019,fernandez_hydrogen_2015,boisse_modelling_2014,boisse_modeling_2014,becquart_microstructural_2010} or from methods based on machine learning (pseudo-potentials) \sidecite{lam_modeling_2021,behler_constructing_2015}.

\begin{figure} [h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/faney_md.jpg}
    \caption{Example of the trajectory of a He$_2$ cluster. Reproduced from \cite{faney_numerical_2013}}
    \label{fig: md faney}
\end{figure}

By measuring the trajectory of a diffusing species from MD simulations for a long time, its diffusion coefficient $D$ can be estimated from Einstein equation \cite{einstein_uber_1905}:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\langle R^2(t) \rangle}{6t} = D
\end{equation}
where $\langle R^2(t) \rangle$ is the mean squared displacement of the species.

This modelling technique was used to estiamte the diffusion coefficient of H in W \sidecite{wang_molecular_2020, zhou_molecular_2016,kato_super-saturated_2015,liu_hydrogen_2014} and for He in W \sidecite{faney_numerical_2013,faney_spatially_2014,faney_spatially_2015,sefta_surface_2013,perez_mobility_2017}.

% Experiments
Diffusivity of hydrogen has also been measured experimentally in W \sidecite{frauenfelder_solution_1969, anderl_hydrogen_1990}, EUROFER \sidecite{montupet-leblond_permeation_2021,esteban_hydrogen_2007,aiello_hydrogen_2002}, Copper and copper alloys (CuCrZr) \sidecite{anderl_deuterium_1992} and other metals.
Because He tends to cluster (as explained below), measuring its diffusivity experimentally is extremely complicated and therefore most estimations of He diffusion coefficient are numerical.
% if you have time, it'd be nice to have a graph showing the diffusion coefficients of H and He according to different authors

\subsubsection{Trapping at defects}

Due to the repulsion between solute species and the surrounding metal atoms, defects can act as wells of potential energy for solute species (see Figure \ref{fig: potential diagrams}).
Once in that attractive well, species can escape it only if their vibrational energy (\textit{ie} their energy/temperature) is high enough.
Species can be trapped at vacancies, disolcation loops, self-interstitial atoms (in the case of hydrogen in tungsten), impurities, etc.

The trapping process can be described as:
\begin{equation}
    \ce{S + T <=>[k][p] S^*}
\end{equation}
where S is the particle in an interstitial site (\textit{ie} mobile), T is the defect and S$^*$ represents the particle trapped in the defect T.
The trapping rate and detrapping rate can be respectively expressed as:
\begin{align}
    k &= k_0 \exp{\frac{-E_k}{k_B T}} \\
    p &= p_0 \exp{\frac{-(E_\mathrm{b} + E_k)}{k_B T}} = p_0 \exp{\frac{-E_p}{k_B T}}
\end{align}
where $E_k$ is the trapping energy in \si{eV}, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant in \si{eV.K^{-1}}, $T$ is the temperature in \si{K}, $E_\mathrm{b}$ is the binding energy of the particle with the defect and $E_p = E_\mathrm{b} + E_k$ is the detrapping energy.
A common assumption is that $E_k = E_D$.

Each rate therefore has two parameters: the pre-activation factor and the activation energy.
These parameters can be measured from fitting Thermo-Desorption Spectrometry (TDS) experiments.
TDS experiments consist in loading a metal sample with the studied species (\textit{eg} H or He) and heat it at different temperatures (typically with a well controlled temperature ramp) while measuring the desorption flux.
This results in a spectrum which typically has one or several desorption peaks corresponding to different traps (see Equation \ref{fig: TDS example ialovega}).
Peaks appearing at high temperatures correspond to "deep" traps with a high detrapping energy $E_p$.

\begin{figure} [h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/tds_helium_nicolas.pdf}
    \caption{H TDS spectra of pre-damaged W. Reproduced from \cite{ialovega_hydrogen_2020}.}
    \label{fig: TDS example ialovega}
\end{figure}

These parameters can also be obtained from DFT calculations \sidecite{hodille_modelling_2021, hodille_hydrogen_2018, backer_multiscale_2017,lu_review_2014}.

Some defects can trap several hydrogen/helium atoms.
For instance, up to approximately seven helium atoms can be trapped in a mono-vacancy \sidecite{faney_spatially_2015}.
DFT calculations also show that defects like mono-vacancies, dislocations or grain boundaries can retain multiple hydrogen atoms (see Figure \ref{fig: trapping energy hydrogen in tungsten}).
As the number of trapped particles (helium or hydrogen) increases, the binding energy of a particle with the defect usually decreases.
In other words, the more particles are trapped in a defect the easier it is for a hydrogen atom to escape.
For instance, the binding energy of a helium atom in an empty mono-vacancy is around \SI{4}{eV} and around \SI{2.5}{eV} if the vacancy already retains four helium atoms \cite{faney_spatially_2015}.
Similarly, the binding energy of a hydrogen atom in a mono-vacancy varies from \SI{0.5}{eV} (with six hydrogen atoms trapped) to \SI{1.3}{eV} (empty vacancy).

    \label{fig: trapping energy hydrogen in tungsten}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Surface processes}

When a surface is in contact with a gas, absorption of species can be described by an absorption flux:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi_\mathrm{abs} = n K_\mathrm{abs} P
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the absorption order, $K_\mathrm{abs}$ is the absorption coefficient expressed in \si{m^{-2}.s^{-1}.Pa^{-1}} and $P$ is the partial pressure of hydrogen in \si{Pa}.

Desorption of solute species at the surface is expressed by a desorption flux:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi_\mathrm{des} = K_\mathrm{des} c_\mathrm{surface}^n
\end{equation}
where $K_\mathrm{des}$ is the desorption coefficient expressed in \si{m^{-2+3n}.s^{-1}}, $c_\mathrm{surface}$ is the surface concentration in \si{m^{-3}}, and $n$ is the order of the desorption.

When the equilibrium between absorption and desorption is reached, $\varphi_\mathrm{abs} = \varphi_\mathrm{des}$, which gives:
\begin{equation}
    n K_\mathrm{abs} P = K_\mathrm{des} c_\mathrm{surface}^n
    \label{eq: equilibrium absorption desorption}
\end{equation}

By rearranging Equation \ref{eq: equilibrium absorption desorption}:
\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{surface} = \sqrt[n]{n \frac{K_\mathrm{abs}}{K_\mathrm{des}}} \sqrt[n]{P}
\end{equation}

When the absorption/desorption order is $n=1$ (monoatomic absorption):
\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{surface} = K_H P
\end{equation}
This relationship is known as Henry's law of solubility and $K_H = K_\mathrm{abs}/K_\mathrm{des}$ is the material solubility expressed in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-1}}.

When the absorption/desorption order is $n=2$ (diatomic absorption):
\begin{equation}
    c_\mathrm{surface} = K_S \sqrt{P}
\end{equation}
This equilbrium is known as Sievert's law of solubility and $K_S = \sqrt{2 K_\mathrm{abs}/K_\mathrm{des}}$ is the material solubility expressed in \si{m^{-3}.Pa^{-0.5}}.

\subsubsection{Clustering}
Single He atoms implanted into the material diffuse rapidly due to the high W-He repulsion.
This high repulsive W-He interaction is such that interstitial He atoms preferably rearrange into groups of atoms in order to minimise the number of repulsive interactions \sidecite{hamid_molecular_2019, hammond_large-scale_2018}.
This phenomena, called "clustering", was highlighted by DFT studies \cite{becquart_density_2009,dunn_rate_2013} and MD simulations \cite{henriksson_molecular_2006}.
Small clusters are themselves mobile as long as all the He atoms within the cluster are occupying interstitial position in the solid lattice.
The activation energy for interstitial He atoms and clusters in W ranges from 0.15 to \SI{0.45}{eV} according to Perez \textit{et al} \sidecite{perez_mobility_2017}.
He clusters will eventually grow by interacting with either interstitial He atoms or other clusters.

Clustering of H atoms is less clear and Henriksson \textit{et al} showed that H atoms do not form bonds with other H atoms in bcc W \sidecite{henriksson_difference_2005}.

\subsubsection{Bubble nucleation}

If its size is big enough the cluster pressure is sufficient to knock off a W atom from the lattice, creating a W vacancy and an interstitial W atom (a Frenkel pair).
This process is called trap mutation or \textit{self-trapping} and the trapped clusters act as nuclei for bubble formation.

Trap mutation has been modelled in W using DFT \sidecite{boisse_modelling_2014} and Monte Carlo computations \sidecite{de_backer_modeling_2015}.
It has been shown that this phenomena depends not only on the number of He atoms in the cluster but also on temperature, position of the cluster to the free surface or even the crystal orientation \sidecite{blondel_modeling_2017, hu_interactions_2014, hu_dynamics_2014}.
At this point, the trapped cluster occupies the newly created W vacancy position.
It is considered immobile since it would requires either diffusion of another vacancy next to it, or recombination of the Frenkel pair in order to diffuse \sidecite{morishita_nucleation_2007}.

\subsubsection{Bubble growth}

    \label{fig: he bubbles ialovega}
\end{figure}

Once a bubble nucleus is created via trap mutation, it can continue to grow via three main mechanisms: absorption of clusters, loop punching or blistering.
Two or more bubbles can also coalesce and form a bigger bubble.
Condon and Schober \sidecite{condon_hydrogen_1993} reviewed the key mechanisms of bubble growth in metals.

Each of these mechanisms can become dominant over another depending on the implantation and the metal conditions. 
Bubbles can continue to grow by absorbing interstitial He atoms or mobile He clusters (\textit{ie} that haven't self trapped).
Considering that vacancies are mobile in the solid, the volume of a bubble could also increase if a vacancy or a vacancy cluster interact with a He bubble.
The same is true for He-vacancies or H-vacancies clusters.

There is no experimental evidence of He clustering with interstitial W atoms \sidecite{faney_spatially_2014}.

% This process is described by cluster dynamics equations in which interaction between the clusters is governed by pairs of association and dissociation rates.
During the growth of a He bubble by absorbing He atoms, if the pressure increases until reaching a critical value, dislocation loop punching can occur.
During the punching event, a whole facet of W atoms is pushed and the vacant lattice sites are absorbed by the bubble allowing the bubble to expand and reducing the pressure in it \sidecite{sefta_surface_2013}.
The produced self-interstitial W atoms will likely be attracted by \textit{image forces} at the surface and will contribute to the roughening of the surface and/or formation of surface structures.

Dislocation loops happen at very high pressure and if the number of vacancies in the lattice is low compared to the amount of He atoms.
This is the case when a high He flux is applied and the He ions energy is low so that no displacement damaged is produced \sidecite{sefta_surface_2013}.
If vacancies were created via He ions implantation, they could interact with existing He bubbles which would have the effect of increasing the volume and thus decreasing the pressure (assuming no change in temperature and no other implantation mechanism).

Coalescence of He bubbles has been observed in MD simulations \sidecite{hamid_molecular_2019, hammond_helium_2019, zhang_simulation_2019} and would tend to increase the bubble size decreasing the bubble density at the same time.
This may not have an impact on He concentration on the macroscopic scale but might influence bubble bursting.

The pressure inside the bubble and the bubble radius are two parameters of interest and are correlated.
Sefta and co-workers \sidecite{sefta_surface_2013} proposed to use the Wolfer equation of state in order to determine the number of He atoms contained in a He bubble based on its pressure, the latter being calculated from its radius and its surface tension.
Quir\'os \textit{et al} proposed a post-processing method to asses bubble radius and pressure from concentration profiles applied on H blistering \sidecite{quiros_blister_2017}.
One must be aware that if radii and pressure of bubbles computation is quite straightforward using MD \sidecite{zhang_simulation_2019} or cluster dynamics \sidecite{faney_spatially_2015} simulations it will be more complex to estimate these metrics considering a continuum model that does not keep track of every type of clusters but only a few of them.
The only information \textit{a priori} available in this case is indeed the local helium concentration and an equivalence could be found by either having a high density of small bubbles or a low density of big bubbles.

\subsubsection{Consequences of bubble growth}

% blistering
When He is implanted at low temperature (<1000K) in W surfaces, appearance of blisters is observed \sidecite{baldwin_formation_2010}.
These blisters are plastic deformation (swelling) of the metal near the surface due to high pressure in He bubbles.
This phenomena is separated from the loop punching even though loop punching can be considered as a plastic deformation.
Blistering happens only at low temperatures because only then the growth rate of the bubble is greater than the dissolution in the bulk (which depends on the thermally activated diffusion coefficient and/or solubility).
Eventually if the rate of incoming He atoms is greater that the rate of re-dissolution in the bulk, blisters can rupture.
Similarly, if the rate of incoming He atoms is lesser than the rate of re-dissolution in the bulk, the blister will collapse.

H blistering was also observed in W \sidecite{haasz_effect_1999} and aluminium and beryllium \sidecite{quiros_blistering_2019,quiros_blister_2017}.
Causey \textit{et al} also reviewed a wide range of studies showing H exposure leads to blistering \sidecite{causey_hydrogen_2002}.

% bursting

\begin{figure} [h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/bubble_bursting_zhou.jpg}
    \caption{Molecular dynamics simulation of He bubble bursting in W. Reproduced from \cite{zhou_growth_2019}.}
    \label{fig: bubble bursting zhou}
\end{figure}

When a bubble grows near the surface and is over-pressurised, bursting can occur (see Figure \ref{fig: bubble bursting zhou}).
After several increases of the bubble volume via punching loops making the W lattice to be deformed and the ligament thickness to decrease, the latter can rupture which would make all the He atoms contained in the bubble to be released to the vacuum.
This is why He bursting is characterised by sharp drops in the He inventory.

Sefta and co-workers observed that bursting is more likely to happen at high temperatures.
This phenomena contributes to surface roughening and could be the beginning of the formation of nano-fuzz \sidecite{sefta_helium_2013}.
Indeed, a bursting event could either form a crater on the W surface or an empty cavity due to self-healing.
In the last case, called a \textit{pinhole} bursting event, the cavity can be re-pressurised with He atoms.
Blondel \textit{et al} proposed to model bursting as a stochastic function of depth in the material rather than a calculation of the bubble pressure.
They have also shown that simulation parameters have an impact on the retention \sidecite{blondel_continuum-scale_2018}.
These differences are mainly due to 2D effects as more bursting events occur but with smaller bubbles.
They have shown that the size of the reaction network size (using cluster dynamics) does not seem to have an influence (between 250 and 200) as the first bursting events happen at clusters of size $\text{He}_{80}$.
Other simulation parameters (depth of the sample, pre-existing vacancies, bubble growth trajectory...) don't affect the simulations results as they converge for long time steps (100 s).

If bursting is not included in continuum simulations, the volume fraction of He present in the W could become very large and the dilute limit approximation could no longer be valid \sidecite{sefta_surface_2013}.
Care must though be taken considering what metric should be considered in continuum simulation in order to estimate bursting probability.


Bursting has been experimentally observed \sidecite{hamid_molecular_2019, woller_dynamic_2015} leading to craters formation.


\subsubsection{W tendrils or "nano-fuzz"}

\begin{figure} [h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/fuzz_alcator_wright.jpg}
    \caption{W fuzz observed in Alcator C-Mod. Reproduced from \cite{wright_tungsten_2012}}
    \label{fig: w fuzz wright}
\end{figure}

In 2012, Wright \textit{et al} \sidecite{wright_tungsten_2012} observed the formation of nanostructures on the surfaces of the W divertor of the reactor Alcator C-mod.
These nanostructures are made of W tendrils (see Figure \ref{fig: w fuzz wright}).
These structures are called W fuzz, nano-fuzz or even fuzzy W.
Because a small portion of the divertor grew W fuzz, no conclusion was made regarding its influence on the plasma operation.
However, if these structures were to be removed during plasma operation via erosion, W atoms could be fed into the plasma, affecting the tokamak performances.
Moreover, this phenomena could increase the W dust formation in the reactor and lead to contamination and safety issues.

W fuzz has been observed at high temperature (>1000K), high flux (>\SI{1e21}{He^+.m^{-2}.s^{-1}}) and long exposure (t>\SI{1e2}{s}) \sidecite{baldwin_formation_2010, nishijima_sputtering_2011}.

The reason of the fuzz formation is still unclear but could be due to bursting events and/or accumulation of self interstitial W atoms at the surface \sidecite{baldwin_effects_2009, baldwin_helium_2008, woller_dynamic_2015, hammond_helium_2017}.
Thermal properties of the media are also affected by the formation of W fuzz \sidecite{wirtz_influence_2016} which could have a severe impact during ELM-like events.
After 1h of plasma implantation, nanostructuring can be found deep in the bulk (up to several hundred of $\mu$m).
According to Baldwin and Doerner \sidecite{baldwin_formation_2010}, heavy alloying helps reducing the formation of He induced fuzz.

Bernard \textit{et al} showed that temperature has a strong influence on fuzz formation \sidecite{bernard_temperature_2017} and Takamura \textit{et al} showed fuzz could be grown under relevant tokamak conditions (high-flux He plasma irradiation and surface temperature greater than \SI{1250}{K}) \sidecite{takamura_formation_2006}.

\begin{figure} [h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter1/fuzz_mccarthy.jpg}
    \caption{Fuzzy W scanning/transmission electron microscopy images showing the presence of He bubbles in tendrils. Reproduced from \cite{mccarthy_enhanced_2020}}
    \label{fig: w fuzz mccarthy}
\end{figure}

McCarthy \textit{et al} studied the formation of W fuzz (see Figure \ref{fig: w fuzz mccarthy}) at helium fluences ranging from \SI{4e23}{m^{-2}} to \SI{e25}{m^{-2}}, temperatures ranging from \SI{1050}{K} to \SI{1150}{K} and He ion energies from \SI{80}{eV} to \SI{100}{eV}.
They identified different fuzz growth regimes depending on the He fluence due to the change in porosity of the fuzzy layer during the growth process.
The rate of growth was found to be dependent on the temperature and the state (ion or atom) of the incident He particles.

Recent modelling work also showed temperature could significantly affect the bursting of He bubbles and therefore the growth of W fuzz \sidecite{niu_effect_2021}.

De Temmerman \textit{et al} concluded that temperature was the most critical parameter controlling W fuzz growth \sidecite{de_temmerman_nanostructuring_2012}.

\subsubsection{Cracks}

The role of He implantation in cracks formation is still unclear since cracks have also been observed during pure thermal shock on W PFC \sidecite{wirtz_influence_2016}.
Under some specific conditions, cracks can close due to thermal expansion which induce frictional loads on the structure.
The formation of W nano-fuzz could also bridge those cracks as observed by Lemahieu \textit{et al} \sidecite{lemahieu_h/he_2016}.

\subsubsection{Diminution of thermal performances}

Several of the above phenomena can have an impact on plasma facing materials thermal performances \sidecite{cui_thermal_2017,buzi_response_2017}.
First, having a network of bubbles will lead to a reduction of local apparent conductivity as thermal constriction will occur between the bubbles.
Therefore, for a given heat load of the surface of a PFC, temperature will likely increase.
Then, development of surface structures will be accompanied by surface roughening therefore modifying the reflectivity and emissivity \sidecite{tokunaga_synergistic_2004}.
For a given incident flux, the net radiative flux to which the surface of the component is exposed will then increase.
This could lead to reduction of the PFC heat exhaust capacity and furthermore local melting \sidecite{wirtz_influence_2016}.

% Having He transport affecting heat transfer significantly would lead to a strong coupling between the two (since He transport is strongly temperature dependent) which would imply to think of proper ways to deal with this coupling numerically.

% NOTE: an interesting study would be to investigate thermal constriction due to the presence of inhomogeneities (He bubbles) in which thermal conductivity is low compared to the one of the W.

\subsection{He/H interactions}
Lee \textit{et al} studied the influence of He implantation on D retention.
They showed with ERD depth profiles (up to 40 nm) that D is trapped where He is trapped and proposed that He bubbles produce secondary defects around them which can trap D \sidecite{lee_hydrogen_2007}.
These defects can be interstitial loops produced by loop punching.
Lee \textit{et al} also suggested that no evidence had been found on trapping of D by chemisorption on the inner surface of a He bubble nor by molecular interaction with the He cluster.
The privileged mechanism is therefore the trapping of D in the defects made by the stress field induced by the He bubble to the crystalline structure of the W.

It has been shown by Ueda \textit{et al} that He implantation (even in small amounts) greatly affects H blistering in W \sidecite{ueda_simultaneous_2009}.
With only 0.1\% of He in the ion beam one can observe that H blistering is completely suppressed for temperature greater than \SI{653}{K}.
At lower temperature, H blistering occurs but is significantly reduced.
This phenomena is due to the fact that H migration to the bulk and accumulation at grain boundaries is avoided by He bubbles at the near surface which act as a diffusion plug for H.
The same phenomena has been observed by Miyamoto \textit{et al} \sidecite{miyamoto_microscopic_2011} which contributes to reducing H retention.
Markelj \textit{et al} \sidecite{markelj_hydrogen_2017} showed however that He implantation can increase D retention in the He clustering zone.
This implies that observed reduction or increase of D retention in mixed H-He plasma experiment are depending on the depth of implantation.

Ialovega \textit{et al} performed sequential H implantation/desorption cycles on W samples pre-damaged with He \sidecite{ialovega_hydrogen_2020}.
He bubbles were found in the near surface region (see Figure \ref{fig: he bubbles ialovega}) and significantly different TDS spectra were observed after several H implantations/desorptions (see Figure \ref{fig: TDS example ialovega}).
This works gives evidence of an interaction between He and H in W.

\section{Macroscopic scale modelling of hydrogen transport}

Several simulation tools have been developed throughout the years (see Table \ref{tab: code comparison}).
Many of them rely of Finite Differences (FD) whereas the HIT code \cite{candido_integrated_2020} relies on Finite Element (FE).
Most of these codes are not able to run multi-material, multi-dimensional simulations.
Moreover, not all of them have an integrated heat transfer solver.

\section{Roadmap}

This PhD work aims at estimating the retention of H isotopes in tokamak components and how the presence of helium could affect it.
The first part of this work is to develop a modelling tool capable of solving H transport problem in 2D/3D (Chapter \ref{Chapter2}).
This new modelling tool is then applied to component scale problems and H retention is estimated at the monoblock level (Chapter \ref{Chapter3}).
The next stage is to scale up from a monoblock model to a full divertor model (Chapter \ref{Chapter4}).
Finally, the influence of He exposure is studied (Chapter \ref{Chapter5}).
