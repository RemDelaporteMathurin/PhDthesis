\subsection{Tokamaks: how to put the sun in a bottle}

A these temperatures, the DT gas becomes a plasma where electrons are teared out from the nuclei.
The principle of magnetic confinement reactors is to trap the electrically charged particles in a magnetic cages.
The electrons and ions will gyrate around the magnetic field lines.
The Larmor radius of the gyration is given by:
\begin{equation}
    R =  \frac{\sqrt{2 m T}}{e B}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $T$ its temperature, $e$ its charge and $B$ the magnetic field.
In a hot plasma (\SI{10}{keV}) with a strong magnetic field of \SI{3}{T}, the Larmor radius of ions is $\approx \SI{1}{mm}$, which is much smaller compared to the size of a reactor.
The Larmor radius of an electron is orders of magnitude smaller due to its lower mass.
Straight magnetic lines can therefore confine charged particles in the direction perpendicular to the field lines.
The particles are however not confined in the parrallel direction.

This issue is simply solved by closing the field lines, forming a torus-shaped magnetic field.
However, this configuration poses another problem: the

\subsection{He/H}
Lee \textit{et al} studied the influence of He implantation on D retention.
They showed with ERD depth profiles (up to 40 nm) that D is trapped where He is trapped and proposed that He bubbles produce secondary defects around them which can trap D \cite{lee_hydrogen_2007}.
These defects can be interstitial loops produced by loop punching.
Lee \textit{et al} also suggested that no evidence had been found on trapping of D by chemisorption on the inner surface of a He bubble nor by molecular interaction with the He cluster.
The privileged mechanism is therefore the trapping of D in the defects made by the stress field induced by the He bubble to the crystalline structure of the W.

It has been shown by Ueda \textit{et al} that He implantation (even in small amounts) greatly affects H blistering in W \cite{ueda_simultaneous_2009}.
With only 0.1\% of He in the ion beam one can observe that H blistering is completely suppressed for temperature greater than \SI{653}{K}.
At lower temperature, H blistering occurs but is reduced significantly.
This phenomena is due to the fact that H migration to the bulk and accumulation at grain boundaries is avoided by He bubbles at the near surface which act as a diffusion plug for H.
The same phenomena has been observed by Miyamoto \textit{et al} \cite{miyamoto_microscopic_2011} which contributes to reducing H retention.
Markelj \textit{et al} \cite{markelj_hydrogen_2017} shown however that He implantation does increase D retention in the He clustering zone.
This implies that observed reduction or increase of D retention in mixed H-He plasma experiment are depending on the depth of implantation.
